{"title": "Optimized Minimal 3D Gaussian Splatting", "author": "Joo Chan Lee and Jong Hwan Ko and Eunbyung Park", "abstract": "  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for\nreal-time, high-performance rendering, enabling a wide range of applications.\nHowever, representing 3D scenes with numerous explicit Gaussian primitives\nimposes significant storage and memory overhead. Recent studies have shown that\nhigh-quality rendering can be achieved with a substantially reduced number of\nGaussians when represented with high-precision attributes. Nevertheless,\nexisting 3DGS compression methods still rely on a relatively large number of\nGaussians, focusing primarily on attribute compression. This is because a\nsmaller set of Gaussians becomes increasingly sensitive to lossy attribute\ncompression, leading to severe quality degradation. Since the number of\nGaussians is directly tied to computational costs, it is essential to reduce\nthe number of Gaussians effectively rather than only optimizing storage. In\nthis paper, we propose Optimized Minimal Gaussians representation (OMG), which\nsignificantly reduces storage while using a minimal number of primitives.\nFirst, we determine the distinct Gaussian from the near ones, minimizing\nredundancy without sacrificing quality. Second, we propose a compact and\nprecise attribute representation that efficiently captures both continuity and\nirregularity among primitives. Additionally, we propose a sub-vector\nquantization technique for improved irregularity representation, maintaining\nfast training with a negligible codebook size. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that OMG reduces storage requirements by nearly 50% compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art and enables 600+ FPS rendering while maintaining high\nrendering quality.

{"title": "A LoD of Gaussians: Unified Training and Rendering for Ultra-Large Scale\n  Reconstruction with External Memory", "author": "Felix Windisch and Thomas K\u00f6hler and Lukas Radl and Michael Steiner and Dieter Schmalstieg and Markus Steinberger", "abstract": "  Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view\nsynthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of\nsmall scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on\npartitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at\nchunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly\nsuited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with\nstreet-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU\nmemory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce\nA LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale\nGaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our\nmethod stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a\nLevel-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the\nrelevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with\nSequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a\nlightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to\nsupport real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable\nseamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex\nscenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.\n", "link":

{"title": "UMA: Ultra-detailed Human Avatars via Multi-level Surface Alignment", "author": "Heming Zhu and Guoxing Sun and Christian Theobalt and Marc Habermann", "abstract": "  Learning an animatable and clothed human avatar model with vivid dynamics and\nphotorealistic appearance from multi-view videos is an important foundational\nresearch problem in computer graphics and vision. Fueled by recent advances in\nimplicit representations, the quality of the animatable avatars has achieved an\nunprecedented level by attaching the implicit representation to drivable human\ntemplate meshes. However, they usually fail to preserve the highest level of\ndetail, particularly apparent when the virtual camera is zoomed in and when\nrendering at 4K resolution and higher. We argue that this limitation stems from\ninaccurate surface tracking, specifically, depth misalignment and surface drift\nbetween character geometry and the ground truth surface, which forces the\ndetailed appearance model to compensate for geometric errors. To address this,\nwe propose a latent deformation model and supervising the 3D deformation of the\nanimatable character using guidance from foundational 2D video point trackers,\nwhich offer improved robustness to shading and surface variations, and are less\nprone to local minima than differentiable rendering. To mitigate the drift over\ntime and lack of 3D awareness of 2D point trackers, we introduce a cascaded\ntraining strategy that generates consistent 3D point tracks by anchoring point\ntracks to the rendered avatar, which ultimately supervises our avatar at the\nvertex and texel level. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\nintroduce a novel dataset comprising five multi-view video sequences, each over\n10 minutes in duration, captured using 40 calibrated 6K-resolution cameras,\nfeaturing subjects dressed in clothing with challenging texture patterns and\nwrinkle deformations. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved\nperformance in rendering quality and geometric accuracy over the prior state of\nthe art.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01802v2", "date":

{"title": "Particle-Grid Neural Dynamics for Learning Deformable Object Models from\n  RGB-D Videos", "author": "Kaifeng Zhang and Baoyu Li and Kris Hauser and Yunzhu Li", "abstract": "  Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their\ndiverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from\nlimited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics\nframework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid\nrepresentation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion\ninformation while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of\nobjects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,\nwhile the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity\nand enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual\nrendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of\ndeformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse\nobjects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from\nsparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also\ngeneralizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase\nthe utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling\ngoal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

{"title": "SLAM&Render: A Benchmark for the Intersection Between Neural Rendering,\n  Gaussian Splatting and SLAM", "author": "Samuel Cerezo and Gaetano Meli and Tom\u00e1s Berriel Martins and Kirill Safronov and Javier Civera", "abstract": "  Models and methods originally developed for Novel View Synthesis and Scene\nRendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, are\nincreasingly being adopted as representations in Simultaneous Localization and\nMapping (SLAM). However, existing datasets fail to include the specific\nchallenges of both fields, such as sequential operations and, in many settings,\nmulti-modality in SLAM or generalization across viewpoints and illumination\nconditions in neural rendering. Additionally, the data are often collected\nusing sensors which are handheld or mounted on drones or mobile robots, which\ncomplicates the accurate reproduction of sensor motions. To bridge these gaps,\nwe introduce SLAM&Render, a novel dataset designed to benchmark methods in the\nintersection between SLAM, Novel View Rendering and Gaussian Splatting.\nRecorded with a robot manipulator, it uniquely includes 40 sequences with\ntime-synchronized RGB-D images, IMU readings, robot kinematic data, and\nground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic data, the dataset also\nenables the assessment of recent integrations of SLAM paradigms within robotic\napplications. The dataset features five setups with consumer and industrial\nobjects under four controlled lighting conditions, each with separate training\nand test trajectories. All sequences are static with different levels of object\nrearrangements and occlusions. Our experimental results, obtained with several\nbaselines from the literature, validate SLAM&Render as a relevant benchmark for\nthis emerging research area.\n", "link":

{"title": "PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via\n  Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning", "author": "Yicheng Xiao and Yu Chen and Haoxuan Ma and Jiale Hong and Caorui Li and Lingxiang Wu and Haiyun Guo and Jinqiao Wang", "abstract": "  While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved\nremarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding\ntasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains\nan active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy\nof explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,\ne.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local\nregions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual\ndescriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language\nalignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder\nfundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded\nin long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing\nboth visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a\nnovel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and\nprocess lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an\nautomated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,\nlong-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we\nconstruct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million\nsamples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and\npropose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating\nfine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual\ndescriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP\nshowcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form\ntexts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n", "link":

While current spatial\ntraining approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage\nwith precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this\nbottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that\nleverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich\nvideo training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we\ninvestigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world\ntransfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We\nidentify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,\nperspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most\neffective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming\ncomprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights\nenable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just\n25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves\ncompetitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial\nreasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,\nmaintaining performance on general video understanding while showing\nsubstantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.\n", "link":

Building on the recent\nsuccess of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely\ndiscrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a\nsingle architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of\ngeneration tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long\ninteractive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,\noutperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some\ndiffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model\ngenerates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading\ndiffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete\nautoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p\nvideos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,\nhigh-quality video generation.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04675v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 3.027,

{"title": "THEval. Evaluation Framework for Talking Head Video Generation", "author": "Nabyl Quignon and Baptiste Chopin and Yaohui Wang and Antitza Dantcheva", "abstract": "  Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos\nincreasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has\noutpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the\nassessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,\nevaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user\nstudies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8\nmetrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)\nsynchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as\nwell as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we\nstreamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as\nwell as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by\n17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip\nsynchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and\nartifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real\ndataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our\nproposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of\ngenerative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly\nreleased and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress\nin the field.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04520v1",

Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a\npromising \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from\nimage-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone\nenables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains\nconstrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.\nTo bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal\nreasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through\nend-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)\na Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies\ninteractive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and\ndifficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns\nperception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning\nthrough a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce\nVTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive\nreasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently\noutperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive\nreasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing\nimage-interactive reasoning applications.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04460v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.9088, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual

{"title": "Thinking with Video: Video Generation as a Promising Multimodal\n  Reasoning Paradigm", "author": "Jingqi Tong and Yurong Mou and Hangcheng Li and Mingzhe Li and Yongzhuo Yang and Ming Zhang and Qiguang Chen and Tianyi Liang and Xiaomeng Hu and Yining Zheng and Xinchi Chen and Jun Zhao and Xuanjing Huang and Xipeng Qiu", "abstract": "  \"Thinking with Text\" and \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm significantly\nimprove the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)\nImages capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or\ncontinuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct\nmodalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce \"Thinking with Video\", a new paradigm\nthat leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and\ntextual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,\nwe developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench\nencompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing\nPuzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our\nevaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,\nSora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even\nsurpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric\ntasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.\nFurthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also\nfind that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's\nperformance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation\nmodel is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,\npositions \"thinking with video\" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04570v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.8848, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D Scene\n

Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are\nimage-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In\nthis work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both\nno-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of\nthe DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to\npredict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without\nreferences at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our\nown image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,\nunderscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world\nvision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher\ncorrelation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used\nopinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness\nof our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04628v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.8388, "topK": [{"title": "Tuning-Free Noise

{"title": "Information-driven design of imaging systems", "author": "Henry Pinkard and Leyla Kabuli and Eric Markley and Tiffany Chien and Jiantao Jiao and Laura Waller", "abstract": "  Imaging systems have traditionally been designed to mimic the human eye and\nproduce visually interpretable measurements. Modern imaging systems, however,\nprocess raw measurements computationally before or instead of human viewing. As\na result, the information content of raw measurements matters more than their\nvisual interpretability. Despite the importance of measurement information\ncontent, current approaches for evaluating imaging system performance do not\nquantify it: they instead either use alternative metrics that assess specific\naspects of measurement quality or assess measurements indirectly with\nperformance on secondary tasks.\n  We developed the theoretical foundations and a practical method to directly\nquantify mutual information between noisy measurements and unknown objects. By\nfitting probabilistic models to measurements and their noise characteristics,\nour method estimates information by upper bounding its true value. By applying\ngradient-based optimization to these estimates, we also developed a technique\nfor designing imaging systems called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis\nLearning (IDEAL). Our information estimates accurately captured system\nperformance differences across four imaging domains (color photography, radio\nastronomy, lensless imaging, and microscopy). Systems designed with IDEAL\nmatched the performance of those designed with end-to-end optimization, the\nprevailing approach that jointly optimizes hardware and image processing\nalgorithms. These results establish mutual information as a universal\nperformance metric for imaging systems that enables both computationally\nefficient design optimization and evaluation in real-world conditions.\n  A video summarizing this work can be found at:\nhttps://waller-lab.github.io/EncodingInformationWebsite/\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20559v5", "date": "2025-11-06",

{"title": "SurgViVQA: Temporally-Grounded Video Question Answering for Surgical\n  Scene Understanding", "author": "Mauro Orazio Drago and Luca Carlini and Pelinsu Celebi Balyemez and Dennis Pierantozzi and Chiara Lena and Cesare Hassan and Danail Stoyanov and Elena De Momi and Sophia Bano and Mobarak I. Hoque", "abstract": "  Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance\nintraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally\ncoherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to\nstatic image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,\nignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We\npropose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from\nstatic images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder\nto fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and\ntool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then\ndecodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated\nREAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related\nquestions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with\nrephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.\nExperimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset\nshows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,\nparticularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\\% on\nREAL-Colon-VQA and +9\\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions\nfurther confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in\nquestion phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework\nfor temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to\ninterpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively.

A single\nYAML-driven workflow covers classification, retrieval and metric learning; more\nthan 1000 pretrained backbones are exposed through a timm-compatible interface,\ntogether with modular losses, augmentations and distributed-training utilities.\nReproducible recipes match or exceed reference results on ImageNet-1K,\nMS-Celeb-1M and Stanford online products, while one-command export to ONNX or\nHuggingFace bridges research and deployment. By consolidating datasets, models,\nand training techniques into one platform, DORAEMON offers a scalable\nfoundation for rapid experimentation in visual recognition and representation\nlearning, enabling efficient transfer of research advances to real-world\napplications.

UniSplat constructs a 3D latent\nscaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic\nscene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively\nintegrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an\nefficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,\nenabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed\nreconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware\nGaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with\nvoxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to\nenable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust\nand high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera\ncoverage.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04595v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.6314, "topK": [{"title": "RTG-SLAM: Real-time 3D Reconstruction

{"title": "Linear Mode Connectivity under Data Shifts for Deep Ensembles of Image\n  Classifiers", "author": "C. Hepburn and T. Zielke and A. P. Raulf", "abstract": "  The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of\ndeep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,\nthe smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and\nfunctional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data\nprocessing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and\nidentify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an\nadditional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through\nsmall learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether\nmodels converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape\nwith varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC\ntend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different\nbasins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the\ngains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles.

Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering\nnarrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that\nrequire true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we\npresent VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial\nrecall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require\narbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context\nexpansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training\nCambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without\nsacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,\nindicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We\npropose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in\nwhich a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise\n(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this\napproach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that\nspatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,\nselect, and organize experience.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04670v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.4294, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D Scene\n

In this work, we\ninvestigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise\nin federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which\nintegrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon\noptimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively\naddress heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder\ncondition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a\nconvergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our\nknowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with\nrigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise.

{"title": "X-Diffusion: Training Diffusion Policies on Cross-Embodiment Human\n  Demonstrations", "author": "Maximus A. Pace and Prithwish Dan and Chuanruo Ning and Atiksh Bhardwaj and Audrey Du and Edward W. Duan and Wei-Chiu Ma and Kushal Kedia", "abstract": "  Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing\nsource of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline.

To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic\nassistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.\nHowever, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical\ntraining data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of\nmemorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it\noccurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is\nmemorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect\nmedical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:\n(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard\nmedical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including\nover 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The\nresults demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation\nscenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.\nMemorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and\ncan be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of\nclinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated\ndisclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,\nregeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these\nfindings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial\nmemorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,\nminimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond\nsurface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the\nleakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.\n", "link":

In this paper we\ndemonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed\nof a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized\nnear-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and\ngaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only\nimages. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based\nmachine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median\n95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\\% relative to capacity-matched\nintensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid\nocclusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation.

However, current VLA models typically\ncontain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data\npretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as\nlimited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training\nparadigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language\nbackbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.\nIn this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces\ncomputation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong\nperformance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native\nmultimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated\ndiffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together\nforming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the\nrepresentations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,\nsurpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also\nattains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,\nEvo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory\noverhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model\nweights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04555v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy":

{"title": "Forgetting is Everywhere", "author": "Ben Sanati and Thomas L. Lee and Trevor McInroe and Aidan Scannell and Nikolay Malkin and David Abel and Amos Storkey", "abstract": "  A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their\ntendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this\nproblem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades\nof study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the\nunderlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic\ntheory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a\nlearner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a\nloss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure\nof an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a\ncomprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,\ngenerative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate\nhow forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant\nrole in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a\nprincipled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and\nimproving the information retention capabilities of general learning\nalgorithms.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04666v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.2596, "topK": [{"title": "Flexible Visual Recognition by Evidential Modeling of Confusion

{"title": "SAFe-Copilot: Unified Shared Autonomy Framework", "author": "Phat Nguyen and Erfan Aasi and Shiva Sreeram and Guy Rosman and Andrew Silva and Sertac Karaman and Daniela Rus", "abstract": "  Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and\nout-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual\nreasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such\nfailures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most\nexisting methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which\nrepresent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying\ndriving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates\nhuman input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our\nmethod leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from\nmulti-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to\nsynthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous\ncontrol. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it\nachieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject\nsurvey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with\narbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive\nbenchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and\nimprovement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at\nthe level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design\nprinciple for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense\nreasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04664v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.2339, "topK": [{"title": "Egocentric Computer Vision for Hands-Free Robotic Wheelchair

{"title": "Studying the Effect of Explicit Interaction Representations on Learning\n  Scene-level Distributions of Human Trajectories", "author": "Anna M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros and Javier Alonso-Mora and Jens Kober", "abstract": "  Effectively capturing the joint distribution of all agents in a scene is\nrelevant for predicting the true evolution of the scene and in turn providing\nmore accurate information to the decision processes of autonomous vehicles.\nWhile new models have been developed for this purpose in recent years, it\nremains unclear how to best represent the joint distributions particularly from\nthe perspective of the interactions between agents. Thus far there is no clear\nconsensus on how best to represent interactions between agents; whether they\nshould be learned implicitly from data by neural networks, or explicitly\nmodeled using the spatial and temporal relations that are more grounded in\nhuman decision-making. This paper aims to study various means of describing\ninteractions within the same network structure and their effect on the final\nlearned joint distributions. Our findings show that more often than not, simply\nallowing a network to establish interactive connections between agents based on\ndata has a detrimental effect on performance. Instead, having well defined\ninteractions (such as which agent of an agent pair passes first at an\nintersection) can often bring about a clear boost in performance.\n", "link":

We propose novel efficient\nsolutions to this problem that are based on the simple idea of using four\ncorrespondences to estimate an approximate geometry of the first two views. We\nmodel this geometry either as an affine or a fully perspective geometry\nestimated using one additional approximate correspondence. We generate such an\napproximate correspondence using a very simple and efficient strategy, where\nthe new point is the mean point of three corresponding input points. The new\nsolvers are efficient and easy to implement, since they are based on existing\nefficient minimal solvers, i.e., the 4-point affine fundamental matrix, the\nwell-known 5-point relative pose solver, and the P3P solver. Extensive\nexperiments on real data show that the proposed solvers, when properly coupled\nwith local optimization, achieve state-of-the-art results, with the novel\nsolver based on approximate mean-point correspondences being more robust and\naccurate than the affine-based solver.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16078v5", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.2281, "topK": [{"title":

{"title": "BoRe-Depth: Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Boundary\n  Refinement for Embedded Systems", "author": "Chang Liu and Juan Li and Sheng Zhang and Chang Liu and Jie Li and Xu Zhang", "abstract": "  Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception\nin unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched\nbecause of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges\nof poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded\nsystems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,\nBoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate\ndepth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.\nFirstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which\nadaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.\nSecondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the\nobject recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is\ndeployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous\nlightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed\nablation studies for the proposed methods.

{"title": "Building Trust in Virtual Immunohistochemistry: Automated Assessment of\n  Image Quality", "author": "Tushar Kataria and Shikha Dubey and Mary Bronner and Jolanta Jedrzkiewicz and Ben J. Brintz and Shireen Y. Elhabian and Beatrice S. Knudsen", "abstract": "  Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains\nfrom hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost\nalternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality\nremains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify\nimage fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an\nautomated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across\nsixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,\nwe generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by\neach virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to\ncompute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly\nquantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual\nannotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,\nincluding Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),\nand structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and\npathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE\nachieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based\nmodels are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.\nMoreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are\ninvisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level\nbenchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for\nassessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate\ntranslation towards routine use by pathologists.\n", "link":

{"title": "Landslide Hazard Mapping with Geospatial Foundation Models: Geographical\n  Generalizability, Data Scarcity, and Band Adaptability", "author": "Wenwen Li and Sizhe Wang and Hyunho Lee and Chenyan Lu and Sujit Roy and Rahul Ramachandran and Chia-Yu Hsu", "abstract": "  Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,\nmaking accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and\nresponse. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when\napplied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited\ntraining data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical\nframework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation\nmodels (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a\nseries of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific\nCNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other\nGeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,\nself-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral\nvariation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more\nreliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these\nstrengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost\nand the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide\nresearch. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and\nscalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04474v1",

{"title": "QCircuitBench: A Large-Scale Dataset for Benchmarking Quantum Algorithm\n  Design", "author": "Rui Yang and Ziruo Wang and Yuntian Gu and Tianyi Chen and Yitao Liang and Tongyang Li", "abstract": "  Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup\nit offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However,\ndesigning and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the\ncomplex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over\nquantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a\nlack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we\nintroduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's\ncapability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum\nprogramming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task\nis fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key\ncontributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features\nof quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for\nquantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3\ntask suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation\nand verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive\nreasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training\ndataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several\ninteresting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error\npatterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all,\nQCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm\ndesign, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07961v2",

{"title": "Beyond Shortest Path: Agentic Vehicular Routing with Semantic Context", "author": "Carnot Braun and Rafael O. Jarczewski and Gabriel U. Talasso and Leandro A. Villas and Allan M. de Souza", "abstract": "  Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics\nlike time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more\nprocesses to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and\nintegrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as\nmulti-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper\nintroduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a\nhybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms\nwith contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)\nagent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective\n(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against\nuser-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a\npre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a\nbenchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user\nintent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its\ninitial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining\nclassical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a\nrobust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable\nsolutions for urban mobility optimization.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04464v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.1851, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to Feel It To Believe It: Multi-Modal Bayesian

We show that an agent can learn to solve\ntasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training\ntimes comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is\nindependent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method\nis environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,\nleading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our\nexperiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and\nstabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any\nobservations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior\nto specific use cases.\n", "link":

The proposed\nsystem integrates three curated datasets: (1) Kvasir-VQA-x1 for question-answer\nlearning, (2) a synthetically enriched explanation dataset offering structured\nmedical reasoning, and (3) text-to-region pairs linking visual features with\nsegmentation masks. This multi-task setup enables the model to jointly learn\nvisual grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, producing responses that are\nboth accurate and interpretable. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer\naccuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded\nmulti-task learning for medical VQA applications.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04384v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.1683, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual

{"title": "Breaking Data Silos: Towards Open and Scalable Mobility Foundation\n  Models via Generative Continual Learning", "author": "Yuan Yuan and Yukun Liu and Chonghua Han and Jie Feng and Yong Li", "abstract": "  Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language\nprocessing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across\ndiverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human\nmobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility\ndata and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we\npropose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training\nmobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing\nraw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by\nreplaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and\nreinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that\nmitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility\npatterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a\nmobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive\nadaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six\nreal-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance\ncomparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning\nbaselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial\nstep toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical\nblueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the\nera of foundation models. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we\nhave released the code and models at\nhttps://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoveGCL.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06694v5", "date":

{"title": "Multimodal Cancer Modeling in the Age of Foundation Model Embeddings", "author": "Steven Song and Morgan Borjigin-Wang and Irene Madejski and Robert L. Grossman", "abstract": "  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a\nlarge-scale reference dataset in cancer through its harmonized genomics,\nclinical, and imaging data. Numerous prior studies have developed bespoke deep\nlearning models over TCGA for tasks such as cancer survival prediction. A\nmodern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation\nmodels (FMs) to derive feature embeddings agnostic to a specific modeling task.\nBiomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA\ncontains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically\nunderutilized. Here, we investigate the ability to train classical machine\nlearning models over multimodal, zero-shot FM embeddings of cancer data. We\ndemonstrate the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming\nunimodal models. Further, we show the benefit of including pathology report\ntext and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and\nhallucination. Overall, we propose an embedding-centric approach to multimodal\ncancer modeling.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07683v3", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.1638, "topK": [{"title": "TAMM:

While real-world language is inherently\nambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically\nbenchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that\nwhile current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive\nassumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on\nambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first\nambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer\ndistributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance\ndeterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the\npredictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,\nand an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically\nexplained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators\nare fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key\nshortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of\ncurrent modeling paradigms.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04418v1", "date":

{"title": "ChessArena: A Chess Testbed for Evaluating Strategic Reasoning\n  Capabilities of Large Language Models", "author": "Jincheng Liu and Sijun He and Jingjing Wu and Xiangsen Wang and Yang Chen and Zhaoqi Kuang and Siqi Bao and Yuan Yao", "abstract": "  Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.\nHowever, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning\nskills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling\nat sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address\nthis question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the\nstrategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic\nreasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,\nand multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a\ncompetitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different\nplay modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.\nThe testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic\nunderstanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different\nmodes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal\nsignificant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess\nengine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random\nplayer that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the\ntestbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,\napproaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.\n", "link":

{"title": "Benchmark Designers Should \"Train on the Test Set\" to Expose Exploitable\n  Non-Visual Shortcuts", "author": "Ellis Brown and Jihan Yang and Shusheng Yang and Rob Fergus and Saining Xie", "abstract": "  Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without\nstrong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and\nsuperficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric\nbenchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic\nprinciple for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.\nDesigners should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using\ndiagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate\nnon-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test\nset'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.\n  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose\nbenchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.\nOur primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language\nModel via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual\ninputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a\nbias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based\ndiagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.\nSecond, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an\n``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four\nbenchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive\nnon-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create\nVSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider\nvision-blind performance gap than the original.\n", "link":

{"title": "TextRegion: Text-Aligned Region Tokens from Frozen Image-Text Models", "author": "Yao Xiao and Qiqian Fu and Heyi Tao and Yuqun Wu and Zhen Zhu and Derek Hoiem", "abstract": "  Image-text models excel at image-level tasks but struggle with detailed\nvisual understanding. While these models provide strong visual-language\nalignment, segmentation models like SAM2 offer precise spatial boundaries for\nobjects. To this end, we propose TextRegion, a simple, effective, and\ntraining-free framework that combines the strengths of image-text models and\nSAM2 to generate powerful text-aligned region tokens. These tokens enable\ndetailed visual understanding while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities.\nThey can be directly applied to various downstream tasks, including open-world\nsemantic segmentation, referring expression comprehension, and grounding. We\nconduct extensive evaluations and consistently achieve superior or competitive\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods. Additionally,\nour framework is compatible with many image-text models, making it highly\npractical and easily extensible as stronger models emerge.

{"title": "Revisiting Federated Fine-Tuning: A Single Communication Round is Enough\n  for Foundation Models", "author": "Ziyao Wang and Bowei Tian and Yexiao He and Zheyu Shen and Guoheng Sun and Yuhan Liu and Luyang Liu and Meng Liu and Ang Li", "abstract": "  The recent advancement of foundation models (FMs) has increased the demand\nfor fine-tuning these models on large-scale cross-domain datasets. To address\nthis, federated fine-tuning has emerged, allowing FMs to be fine-tuned on\ndistributed datasets across multiple devices while ensuring data privacy.\nHowever, the substantial parameter size and the multi-round communication in\nfederated learning algorithms result in prohibitively high communication costs,\nchallenging the practicality of federated fine-tuning. In this paper, we\nidentify and analyze, both theoretically and empirically, that the traditional\nmulti-round aggregation algorithms may not be necessary for federated\nfine-tuning large FMs. Our experiments reveal that a single round of\naggregation (i.e., one-shot federated fine-tuning) yields a global model\nperformance comparable to that achieved through multiple rounds of aggregation.\nThrough rigorous mathematical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that large\nFMs, due to their extensive parameter sizes and pre-training on general tasks,\nachieve significantly lower training loss in one-shot federated fine-tuning\ncompared to smaller models. Our extensive experiments show that one-shot\nfederated fine-tuning significantly reduces communication costs. It also has\nthe potential to enable asynchronous aggregation, enhances privacy, and\nmaintains performance consistency with multi-round federated fine-tuning on\nboth text generation and text-to-image generation tasks. Our findings provide\ninsights to revolutionize federated fine-tuning in practice, enhancing\nefficiency, reducing costs, and expanding accessibility for FMs.\n", "link":

Conventional convolutional operations are fundamentally\nlimited by their linear nature along with fixed activations, where many layers\nare needed to learn meaningful patterns in data. Because of the sheer size of\nthese networks, this approach is simply computationally inefficient, and poses\noverfitting or gradient explosion risks, especially in small datasets. As a\nresult, we introduce a \"plug-in\" module, called Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetwork (RKAN). Our module is highly compact, so it can be easily added into\nany stage (level) of traditional deep networks, where it learns to integrate\nsupportive polynomial feature transformations to existing convolutional\nframeworks. RKAN offers consistent improvements over baseline models in\ndifferent vision tasks and widely tested benchmarks, accomplishing cutting-edge\nperformance on them.\n", "link":

Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV\ndemonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,\nthese techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using\nframeworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static\ngraphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it\ndifficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention\nalgorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such\ntechniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well\nunderstood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this\npaper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and\nDeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be\ndeployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way\ntensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators\nrunning at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real\nproduction setting. SnapStream enables $4\\times$ improved on-chip memory usage\nand introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and\nLiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation\nof sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system\nwith static graphs and continuous batching.\n", "link":

{"title": "Deep Edge Filter: Return of the Human-Crafted Layer in Deep Learning", "author": "Dongkwan Lee and Junhoo Lee and Nojun Kwak", "abstract": "  We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass\nfiltering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.\nOur method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode\ntask-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing\ndomain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By\nsubtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach\nisolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural\nintegrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,\n3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of\nmodel architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces\nfeature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,\nproviding empirical validation of our core hypothesis.

{"title": "HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling for Vision-Language\n  Model", "author": "Youngwan Lee and Kangsan Kim and Kwanyong Park and Ilcahe Jung and Soojin Jang and Seanie Lee and Yong-Ju Lee and Sung Ju Hwang", "abstract": "  Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing\nsafety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text\ninteractions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe\noutcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs\nvulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely\nprimarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to\nintrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a\nholistic safety dataset and benchmark, \\textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five\nsafe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both\ntraining and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular\nframework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to\nassess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a\ndual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can\nalso provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their\nrefusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity;\nthe VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration\nwith diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that\nSafe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety\nperformance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench\nitself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that\nHoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM\nsafety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704v4",

{"title": "Integrating Temporal and Structural Context in Graph Transformers for\n  Relational Deep Learning", "author": "Divyansha Lachi and Mahmoud Mohammadi and Joe Meyer and Vinam Arora and Tom Palczewski and Eva L. Dyer", "abstract": "  In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics\nof relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between\npatients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be\nbroadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range\nspatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also\nsupporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for\nrelational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal\ninformation merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather\nthan a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances\nglobal context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture\ntemporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph\nPerceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning\nthat leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently\nintegrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent\nbottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common\nlatent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire\nrelational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder\nthat supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a\nsingle model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers\nstate-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for\nrelational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04557v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 2.0511, "topK": [{"title": "Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis", "link":

{"title": "GENIAL: Generative Design Space Exploration via Network Inversion for\n  Low Power Algorithmic Logic Units", "author": "Maxence Bouvier and Ryan Amaudruz and Felix Arnold and Renzo Andri and Lukas Cavigelli", "abstract": "  As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming\nincreasingly important for reducing the footprint of digital systems.\nConventional design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristic-based\noptimization, are limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast\ndesign space. In this paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based\nframework for the automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units,\nwith a focus on multipliers.\n  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two\nstages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised\nfinetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area\nfrom abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs. This enables deployment of a high-effort logic synthesis\noptimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nNotably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%\nswitching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads\ncompared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite\nState Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of\nlogic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward\nautomated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for\ndigital systems.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18989v2",

{"title": "Evaluating LLM-Contaminated Crowdsourcing Data Without Ground Truth", "author": "Yichi Zhang and Jinlong Pang and Zhaowei Zhu and Yang Liu", "abstract": "  The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of\nhigh-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the\nincreasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a\nsignificant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be\ncompromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often\nrely on high-dimensional training data such as text, making them unsuitable for\nannotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate\nthe potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information\nwithin workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate\nLLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our\napproach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning\non (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on\nprior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical\nguarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We\nestablish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically\ndemonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world\ncrowdsourcing datasets.\n", "link":

{"title": "Approximate non-linear model predictive control with safety-augmented\n  neural networks", "author": "Henrik Hose and Johannes K\u00f6hler and Melanie N. Zeilinger and Sebastian Trimpe", "abstract": "  Model predictive control (MPC) achieves stability and constraint satisfaction\nfor general nonlinear systems, but requires computationally expensive online\noptimization. This paper studies approximations of such MPC controllers via\nneural networks (NNs) to achieve fast online evaluation. We propose safety\naugmentation that yields deterministic guarantees for convergence and\nconstraint satisfaction despite approximation inaccuracies. We approximate the\nentire input sequence of the MPC with NNs, which allows us to verify online if\nit is a feasible solution to the MPC problem. We replace the NN solution by a\nsafe candidate based on standard MPC techniques whenever it is infeasible or\nhas worse cost. Our method requires a single evaluation of the NN and forward\nintegration of the input sequence online, which is fast to compute on\nresource-constrained systems. The proposed control framework is illustrated\nusing two numerical non-linear MPC benchmarks of different complexity,\ndemonstrating computational speedups that are orders of magnitude higher than\nonline optimization. In the examples, we achieve deterministic safety through\nthe safety-augmented NNs, where a naive NN implementation fails.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09575v3", "date": "2025-11-06",

This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)\npipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic\nDark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for\na forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model\nbased on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one\nmillion self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.\nLeveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural\nnetworks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn\nlow-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with\ntarget parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation\nof the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter\nspace spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias\nparameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear\nbias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference\npipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic\ncontaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.\nOur forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter\nconstraints, achieving $2-3\\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\\Omega_m -\nS_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and\neffectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These\nresults demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for\nupcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04681v1", "date":

{"title": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Neural Operators for Parametric\n  PDEs: A Human-AI Collaborative Analysis", "author": "Zhuo Zhang and Xiong Xiong and Sen Zhang and Yuan Zhao and Xi Yang", "abstract": "  PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on\nparameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional\nnumerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making\nparameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning\nadvances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural\noperators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution\noperators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two\nmain paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and\nexcel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g.,\nDeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between\ninfinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization.\nThrough comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and\nelectromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups\nof $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query\nscenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance\nfor method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation,\nconvergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional\nparameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This\nwork establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers\nvia operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource\nfor this rapidly evolving

{"title": "Where Do LLMs Still Struggle? An In-Depth Analysis of Code Generation\n  Benchmarks", "author": "Amir Molzam Sharifloo and Maedeh Heydari and Parsa Kazerooni and Daniel Maninger and Mira Mezini", "abstract": "  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code\ngeneration, and the race to improve their performance has become a central\nfocus of AI research. Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular,\noffering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight\ninto the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is\ncrucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of\nmore capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks\nacross four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most\nlikely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated\nwhether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by\na systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our\nanalysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as\ncommon complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.\n", "link":

{"title": "Are Minimal Radial Distortion Solvers Necessary for Relative Pose\n  Estimation?", "author": "Charalambos Tzamos and Viktor Kocur and Yaqing Ding and Torsten Sattler and Zuzana Kukelova", "abstract": "  Estimating the relative pose between two cameras is a fundamental step in\nmany applications such as Structure-from-Motion. The common approach to\nrelative pose estimation is to apply a minimal solver inside a RANSAC loop.\nHighly efficient solvers exist for pinhole cameras. Yet, (nearly) all cameras\nexhibit radial distortion. Not modeling radial distortion leads to\n(significantly) worse results. However, minimal radial distortion solvers are\nsignificantly more complex than pinhole solvers, both in terms of run-time and\nimplementation efforts. This paper compares radial distortion solvers with a\nsimple-to-implement approach that combines an efficient pinhole solver with\nsampled radial distortion parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple\ndatasets and RANSAC variants show that this simple approach performs similarly\nor better than the most accurate minimal distortion solvers at faster run-times\nwhile being significantly more accurate than faster non-minimal solvers. We\nclearly show that complex radial distortion solvers are not necessary in\npractice.

{"title": "Temporal Action Selection for Action Chunking", "author": "Yueyang Weng and Xiaopeng Zhang and Yongjin Mu and Yingcong Zhu and Yanjie Li and Qi Liu", "abstract": "  Action chunking is a widely adopted approach in Learning from Demonstration\n(LfD). By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions,\naction chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert\npolicies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of\nrecent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the\ninadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes.\nExisting efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off\nreactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),\nwhich caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically\nselects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves\nbalanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision\nconsistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with\ndiverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates -\nyielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a\nbase policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances\ntraining efficiency and elevates the performance plateau. Experiments in both\nsimulation and physical robots confirm the method's efficacy.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04421v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.9797, "topK": [{"title":

{"title": "Orion-MSP: Multi-Scale Sparse Attention for Tabular In-Context Learning", "author": "Mohamed Bouadi and Pratinav Seth and Aditya Tanna and Vinay Kumar Sankarapu", "abstract": "  Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,\ndeveloping effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to\nheterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple\nscales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN\nand TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to\ngradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,\ncurrent architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature\nprocessing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with\nquadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component\nprocessing that prevents iterative representation refinement and\ncross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce\nOrion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)\nmulti-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)\nblock-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for\nscalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style\nmemory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across\ndiverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance\nwhile scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new\nstandard for efficient tabular in-context learning.

{"title": "Latent learning: episodic memory complements parametric learning by\n  enabling flexible reuse of experiences", "author": "Andrew Kyle Lampinen and Martin Engelcke and Yuxuan Li and Arslan Chaudhry and James L. McClelland", "abstract": "  When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms\ncould improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive\nscience to argue that one weakness of parametric machine learning systems is\ntheir failure to exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not\nrelevant to the task at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We\nshow how this perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in\nlanguage modeling to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight\nhow cognitive science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the\nsolution to these issues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle\nretrieval mechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize\nbetter across many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential\ncomponents for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of\nwithin-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information\nacross retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible\ncontributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning\nsystems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval\nmethods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization. We close\nby discussing some of the links between these findings and prior results in\ncognitive science and neuroscience, and the broader implications.\n", "link":

{"title": "Are language models aware of the road not taken? Token-level uncertainty\n  and hidden state dynamics", "author": "Amir Zur and Atticus Geiger and Ekdeep Singh Lubana and Eric Bigelow", "abstract": "  When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens\nmight lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult\nto quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models\nrepresent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test\nthis hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language\nmodel's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we\nfind a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,\nand how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This\nsuggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are\nalternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet\ncommitted to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations\ncan predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models\nimplicitly represent the space of possible paths.\n", "link":

The tool also\nsupports AI-assisted inline editing of existing test cases. To enhance\ntransparency and interpretability, it reveals the prompts and explanations\nbehind each generation. In a user study (N=24), 83% of participants preferred\nthe tool over manually creating or selecting test cases, as it allowed them to\nrapidly generate diverse synthetic data without additional workload. The\ngenerated synthetic data proved as effective as hand-crafted data for both\nrefining evaluation criteria and aligning with human preferences. These\nfindings highlight synthetic data as a promising alternative, particularly in\ncontexts where efficiency and scalability are critical.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04478v1", "date":

{"title": "Decoding Emergent Big Five Traits in Large Language Models:\n  Temperature-Dependent Expression and Architectural Clustering", "author": "Christos-Nikolaos Zacharopoulos and Revekka Kyriakoglou", "abstract": "  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered\napplications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly\nimportant for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically\nevaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to\nassess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find\nsignificant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with\nNeuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,\nhierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that\narchitectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait\nprofiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence\nof personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model\ntuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems.

{"title": "Towards Causal Market Simulators", "author": "Dennis Thumm and Luis Ontaneda Mijares", "abstract": "  Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for\nsynthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal\nreasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk\nassessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that\ncombines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate\ncounterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal\ndependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints\nthrough directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the\ncausal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic\nautoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating\nsuperior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances\nas low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial\nstress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating\nplausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal\nmechanisms.\n",

{"title": "Q3R: Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer for Effective Low-Rank\n  Training", "author": "Ipsita Ghosh and Ethan Nguyen and Christian K\u00fcmmerle", "abstract": "  Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a\nhighly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,\nthese methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the\nlow-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the\nQuadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel\nlow-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted\nleast squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term\nwhich majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.\nUnlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices\nwith prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive\nperformance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining\nfully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one\nexperiment where we are able to truncate $60\\%$ and $80\\%$ of the parameters of\na ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\\%$ and $~4\\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance\nrespectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both\nimage and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04485v1", "date": "2025-11-06",

{"title": "Learning from Single Timestamps: Complexity Estimation in Laparoscopic\n  Cholecystectomy", "author": "Dimitrios Anastasiou and Santiago Barbarisi and Lucy Culshaw and Jayna Patel and Evangelos B. Mazomenos and Imanol Luengo and Danail Stoyanov", "abstract": "  Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in\nLaparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with\nlonger operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The\nParkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for\nstratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos\nremains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete\nvideos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,\nwe introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity\nestimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal\nsupervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed\nclips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal\nlocalization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading\nmodule. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft\nlocalization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:\nEvaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy\nof 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by\nover 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision\nfor surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable\nand effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation\nfrom full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and\nsurgical training.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04525v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.9237, "topK": [{"title": "CamCtrl3D: Single-Image Scene Exploration with Precise 3D Camera

{"title": "Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A\n  Bias-Variance Trade-off", "author": "Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar and Nicol\u00f2 Michelusi", "abstract": "  Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a\nscalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless\nmultiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing\nOTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming\n\\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or\nforcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous}\nwireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device\nand inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722v3", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.8929, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to Feel It To Believe It: Multi-Modal Bayesian Inference

A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is\nour lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,\nresearchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information\nmust be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications\nranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial\ninformation but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive\nhuman work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source\nsoftware aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by\nlarge language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming\nInterface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and\nvalidation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers\nand output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic\ncomparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced\nusing GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of\nspiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence\nby a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were\nfound in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial\nconservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster\naccess to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in\nprojects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize\nresources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated\nextraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available\nbibliographic data during project planning.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04573v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.8774, "topK":

{"title": "FedQUIT: On-Device Federated Unlearning via a Quasi-Competent Virtual\n  Teacher", "author": "Alessio Mora and Lorenzo Valerio and Paolo Bellavista and Andrea Passarella", "abstract": "  Federated Learning (FL) systems enable the collaborative training of machine\nlearning models without requiring centralized collection of individual data. FL\nparticipants should have the ability to exercise their right to be forgotten,\nensuring their past contributions can be removed from the learned model upon\nrequest. In this paper, we propose FedQUIT, a novel algorithm that uses\nknowledge distillation to scrub the contribution of the data to forget from an\nFL global model while preserving its generalization ability. FedQUIT directly\nworks on client devices that request to leave the federation, and leverages a\nteacher-student framework. The FL global model acts as the teacher, and the\nlocal model works as the student. To induce forgetting, FedQUIT tailors the\nteacher's output on local data (the data to forget) penalizing the prediction\nscore of the true class. Unlike previous work, our method does not require\nhardly viable assumptions for cross-device settings, such as storing historical\nupdates of participants or requiring access to proxy datasets. Experimental\nresults on various datasets and model architectures demonstrate that (i)\nFedQUIT outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in forgetting data, (ii) has\nthe exact computational requirements as a regular FedAvg round, and (iii)\nreduces the cumulative communication costs by up to 117.6$\\times$ compared to\nretraining from scratch to restore the initial generalization performance after\nunlearning.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07587v3", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.8751, "topK": [{"title": "MEDL-U: Uncertainty-aware 3D Automatic Annotation based

{"title": "Large language models replicate and predict human cooperation across\n  experiments in game theory", "author": "Andrea Cera Palatsi and Samuel Martin-Gutierrez and Ana S. Cardenal and Max Pellert", "abstract": "  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in\ndomains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet\nhow closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.\nThis gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical\napplications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs\nineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a\ndigital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic\nprompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing\nthree open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama\nreproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human\ndeviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash\nequilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral\nreplication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation\nprocess. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and\npreregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the\noriginal parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated\nLLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic\nexploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary\napproach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that\ngenerates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.\n", "link":

{"title": "TT-Prune: Joint Model Pruning and Resource Allocation for\n  Communication-efficient Time-triggered Federated Learning", "author": "Xinlu Zhang and Yansha Deng and Toktam Mahmoodi", "abstract": "  Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,\nparticularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional\nevent-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as\na general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into\ndifferent tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists\nof a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,\nconsequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.\nIn this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems\nand study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth\nallocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning\nlatency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the\ngradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the\nobtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio\nand wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under\na given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless\nbandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The\nsimulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost\nby 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04653v1",

{"title": "Universal Fourier Neural Operators for periodic homogenization problems\n  in linear elasticity", "author": "Binh Huy Nguyen and Matti Schneider", "abstract": "  Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available deep-learning\nframeworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional computational\nframeworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to expect of\nmachine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches are\npromising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for\nmicromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational micromechanics\nmethods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct an FNO\nsurrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods and\nshow that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with\narbitrary stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast constraint\nup to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions on the\nmaterial symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the geometry of\nthe interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is sharp and\nuniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical empowerment of\nFNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we construct an FNO\nexplicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the obtained neural\noperator complies with the same memory requirements as the basic scheme and\ncomes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In particular,\nlarge-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily handled. The\ngoal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for solving\nmicromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This connection is\nexpected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12233v3", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.8653, "topK": [{"title": "Dynamic

In this work, we investigate\nhow the quality of LLM responses changes in terms of information accuracy,\ntruthfulness, and refusals depending on three user traits: English proficiency,\neducation level, and country of origin. We present extensive experimentation on\nthree state-of-the-art LLMs and two different datasets targeting truthfulness\nand factuality. Our findings suggest that undesirable behaviors in\nstate-of-the-art LLMs occur disproportionately more for users with lower\nEnglish proficiency, of lower education status, and originating from outside\nthe US, rendering these models unreliable sources of information towards their\nmost vulnerable users.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17737v2", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy":

{"title": "RUST-BENCH: Benchmarking LLM Reasoning on Unstructured Text within\n  Structured Tables", "author": "Nikhil Abhyankar and Purvi Chaurasia and Sanchit Kabra and Ananya Srivastava and Vivek Gupta and Chandan K. Reddy", "abstract": "  Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform\ntables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an\nincomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real\ntables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields\nwith free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To\naddress this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from\n2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)\nand ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates\nLLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning\ncomplexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs\nstruggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing\npersistent weaknesses in current architectures and

This paper presents two complementary efforts\nat Vectara to measure and benchmark LLM faithfulness in RAG.

Motivated by\nlimitations observed in current hallucination detection methods, we introduce\nFaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge framework that leverages a pool of diverse\nhuman-annotated hallucination examples to substantially improve the automated\nhallucination evaluation of LLMs. We introduce an enhanced hallucination\nleaderboard centered on FaithJudge that benchmarks LLMs on RAG faithfulness

Even when they reach correct\nanswers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in\nhigh-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a\nneuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from\nCoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order\nlogic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,\ncommonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation\nenables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises\nallow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.\nExperiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT\neffectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of\nfinal answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for\n(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on\nVeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct\npreference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,\nfurther improving reasoning validity and accuracy.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662v1", "date":

In this work, we significantly expand\nthe types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as\nConvex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.\nWe

{"title": "Projection Methods for Operator Learning and Universal Approximation", "author": "Emanuele Zappala", "abstract": "  We obtain a new universal approximation theorem for continuous (possibly\nnonlinear) operators on arbitrary Banach spaces using the Leray-Schauder\nmapping. Moreover, we introduce and study a method for operator learning in\nBanach spaces $L^p$ of functions with multiple variables, based on orthogonal\nprojections on polynomial bases.

We introduce \\textit{ForeRobo}, a\ngenerative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously\nacquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of\ndirectly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative\nparadigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a\nself-guided \\textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first\nproposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation\nenvironments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to\ngenerate skill-consistent goal states (\\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the\nvirtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed\nstate generation model (\\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise\ncorrespondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the\ncurrent state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,\nclassical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world\nenvironments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared\nwith end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior\ninterpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer\nacross a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and\nobserve an average improvement of 56.32\\% over the state-of-the-art state\ngeneration models, demonstrating strong generality across different\nmanipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than\n20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits\nremarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of\n79.28\\%.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04381v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.8242, "topK": [{"title": "RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned Scene Graph via Interactive

{"title": "Balancing Quality and Variation: Spam Filtering Distorts Data Label\n  Distributions", "author": "Eve Fleisig and Matthias Orlikowski and Philipp Cimiano and Dan Klein", "abstract": "  For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a\npopulation, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out\nspam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and\nrepresentation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator\nfiltering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find\nthat these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single\nground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree\ninstead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy\nand label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal\n(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error\nfrom the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to\nobserve that these methods often assume spam annotators are more random than\nreal spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable\nfrom real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give\nrelatively fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the\npreservation of variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering\nmethods: spammers tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that\nassume variation is spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam\nremoval methods that account for label diversity.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08217v2", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.7982, "topK":

Simulation\nprovides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often\nfail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body\ninteractions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that\nconstructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,\nobjects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation\ntasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,\ndemonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world\nexecution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.\nOur results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with\nhigh-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation\nof robotic manipulation policies.

{"title": "Hemorica: A Comprehensive CT Scan Dataset for Automated Brain Hemorrhage\n  Classification, Segmentation, and Detection", "author": "Kasra Davoodi and Mohammad Hoseyni and Javad Khoramdel and Reza Barati and Reihaneh Mortazavi and Amirhossein Nikoofard and Mahdi Aliyari-Shoorehdeli and Jaber Hatam Parikhan", "abstract": "  Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)\nscans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To\nclose this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372\nhead CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been\nexhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),\nsubarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding\npatient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding\nboxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A\ndouble-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by\nneurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.\nComprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the\ndataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and\ntransformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and\nhemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such\nas MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas\na U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary\nlesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the\nsufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,\nfine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,\nfacilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the\nprocess of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification\nsystems.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22993v2", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.7767, "topK": [{"title": "TAMM:

{"title": "Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language\n  Queries for Tabular Data Analysis", "author": "Daniel Gomm and Cornelius Wolff and Madelon Hulsebos", "abstract": "  Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent\nto queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a\nfeature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query\nspecification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled\nframework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a\nresolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.\nApplying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and\nanalysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an\nuncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's\nexecution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our\nframework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity\nto embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more\ninformed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular\ndata, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.\n", "link":

{"title": "The Mini Wheelbot: A Testbed for Learning-based Balancing, Flips, and\n  Articulated Driving", "author": "Henrik Hose and Jan Weisgerber and Sebastian Trimpe", "abstract": "  The Mini Wheelbot is a balancing, reaction wheel unicycle robot designed as a\ntestbed for learning-based control. It is an unstable system with highly\nnonlinear yaw dynamics, non-holonomic driving, and discrete contact switches in\na small, powerful, and rugged form factor. The Mini Wheelbot can use its wheels\nto stand up from any initial orientation - enabling automatic environment\nresets in repetitive experiments and even challenging half flips. We illustrate\nthe effectiveness of the Mini Wheelbot as a testbed by implementing two popular\nlearning-based control algorithms. First, we showcase Bayesian optimization for\ntuning the balancing controller. Second, we use imitation learning from an\nexpert nonlinear MPC that uses gyroscopic effects to reorient the robot and can\ntrack higher-level velocity and orientation commands. The latter allows the\nrobot to drive around based on user commands - for the first time in this class\nof robots. The Mini Wheelbot is not only compelling for testing learning-based\ncontrol algorithms, but it is also just fun to work with, as demonstrated in\nthe video of our experiments.\n", "link":

{"title": "When Semantics Connect the Swarm: LLM-Driven Fuzzy Control for\n  Cooperative Multi-Robot Underwater Coverage", "author": "Jingzehua Xu and Weihang Zhang and Yangyang Li and Hongmiaoyi Zhang and Guanwen Xie and Jiwei Tang and Shuai Zhang and Yi Li", "abstract": "  Underwater multi-robot cooperative coverage remains challenging due to\npartial observability, limited communication, environmental uncertainty, and\nthe lack of access to global localization. To address these issues, this paper\npresents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language\nModels (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw\nmultimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact,\nhuman-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored\nregions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy\ninference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens\ninto smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation\nwithout relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple\nrobots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local\ncontext in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while\navoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like\nenvironments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed\nframework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with\nimproved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic\ncognition and distributed underwater control in GPS-denied, map-free\nconditions.\n", "link":

Based on the analysis of\nprompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding\nthat text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the\nsource CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by\nthis finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate\nthem via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based\nLLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.\nLater improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified\ncandidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round\nsimplification performance.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04495v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.73, "topK": [{"title": "TAMM: TriAdapter Multi-Modal Learning for 3D

{"title": "Fitting Reinforcement Learning Model to Behavioral Data under Bandits", "author": "Hao Zhu and Jasper Hoffmann and Baohe Zhang and Joschka Boedecker", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to\nsome given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models\nhave received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and\nanimal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization\nproblem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that\nappear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed\ntheoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical\nresults, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL\nmodels based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then\nevaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some\nbenchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate\nthat our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while\nsignificantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python\npackage for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the\nanalysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex\noptimization.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04454v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.7282, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to Feel It To Believe It: Multi-Modal Bayesian

In this article we develop an ODE based method to\nstudy the Adam optimizer in a fast-slow scaling regime. For fixed momentum\nparameters and vanishing step-sizes, we show that the Adam algorithm is an\nasymptotic pseudo-trajectory of the flow of a particular vector field, which is\nreferred to as the Adam vector field. Leveraging properties of asymptotic\npseudo-trajectories, we establish convergence results for the Adam algorithm.\nIn particular, in a very general setting we show that if the Adam algorithm\nconverges, then the limit must be a zero of the Adam vector field, rather than\na local minimizer or critical point of the objective function.\n  In contrast, in the overparametrized empirical risk minimization setting, the\nAdam algorithm is able to locally find the set of minima. Specifically, we show\nthat in a neighborhood of the global minima, the objective function serves as a\nLyapunov function for the flow induced by the Adam vector field. As a\nconsequence, if the Adam algorithm enters a neighborhood of the global minima\ninfinitely often, it converges to the set of global minima.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04622v1",

{"title": "Online Algorithms for Repeated Optimal Stopping: Achieving Both\n  Competitive Ratio and Regret Bounds", "author": "Tsubasa Harada and Yasushi Kawase and Hanna Sumita", "abstract": "  We study the repeated optimal stopping problem, which generalizes the\nclassical optimal stopping problem with an unknown distribution to a setting\nwhere the same problem is solved repeatedly over $T$ rounds. In this framework,\nwe aim to design algorithms that guarantee a competitive ratio in each round\nwhile also achieving sublinear regret across all rounds.\n  Our primary contribution is a general algorithmic framework that achieves\nthese objectives simultaneously for a wide array of repeated optimal stopping\nproblems. The core idea is to dynamically select an algorithm for each round,\nchoosing between two candidates: (1) an empirically optimal algorithm derived\nfrom the history of observations, and (2) a sample-based algorithm with a\nproven competitive ratio guarantee. Based on this approach, we design an\nalgorithm that performs no worse than the baseline sample-based algorithm in\nevery round, while ensuring that the total regret is bounded by\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$.\n  We demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework to canonical\nproblems, including the prophet inequality, the secretary problem, and their\nvariants under adversarial, random, and i.i.d. input models. For example, for\nthe repeated prophet inequality problem, our method achieves a\n$1/2$-competitive ratio from the second round on and an $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$\nregret. Furthermore, we establish a regret lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$\neven in the i.i.d. model, confirming that our algorithm's performance is almost\noptimal with respect to the number of

{"title": "Alternative Fairness and Accuracy Optimization in Criminal Justice", "author": "Shaolong Wu and James Blume and Geshi Yeung", "abstract": "  Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts\nremain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,\nand process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then\ndevelop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact\nparity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping\ndifferences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes\nsolutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the\nethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of\ncritique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the\nexplosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for\ndeployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based\ndecisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions\nand solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and\nprovide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related\ntools.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04505v1",

{"title": "DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for\n  Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "author": "Narjes Nourzad and Hanqing Yang and Shiyu Chen and Carlee Joe-Wong", "abstract": "  Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.0779, "topK": [{"title": "RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned Scene Graph via

{"title": "$\u03bc$NeuFMT: Optical-Property-Adaptive Fluorescence Molecular Tomography\n  via Implicit Neural Representation", "author": "Shihan Zhao and Jianru Zhang and Yanan Wu and Linlin Li and Siyuan Shen and Xingjun Zhu and Guoyan Zheng and Jiahua Jiang and Wuwei Ren", "abstract": "  Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for\nnon-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction\nremains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on\ninaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning\nmethods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization\nbeyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\\mu$NeuFMT, a\nself-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit\nneural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon\npropagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence\ndistribution and the optical properties ($\\mu$) during reconstruction,\neliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or\npre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\\mu$NeuFMT robustly\nrecovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with\nseverely erroneous initial values (0.5$\\times$ to 2$\\times$ of ground truth).\nExtensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\\mu$NeuFMT\noutperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse\nheterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and\naccurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging\nin complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04510v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.5341, "topK": [{"title": "MEDL-U: Uncertainty-aware 3D Automatic Annotation based on Evidential\n

{"title": "Tracking and Understanding Object Transformations", "author": "Yihong Sun and Xinyu Yang and Jennifer J. Sun and Bharath Hariharan", "abstract": "  Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple\nbeing cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through\nthese changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.\nHowever, existing methods often lose track of the target object after\ntransformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address\nthis limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects\nthrough transformations while detecting and describing state changes,\naccompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we\npresent TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after\ntransformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.\nTubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines\nwhether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,\nit reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each\nobserved transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking\nperformance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of\nobject transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and\nsemantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional\nresults, and the benchmark dataset are available at\nhttps://tubelet-graph.github.io.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04678v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.5256,

{"title": "Confidential Computing for Cloud Security: Exploring Hardware based\n  Encryption Using Trusted Execution Environments", "author": "Dhruv Deepak Agarwal and Aswani Kumar Cherukuri", "abstract": "  The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage\ncapacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the\nprocess, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of\nsafeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption\nat rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to\nvarious possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing\nhas been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of\nhardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's\nSoftware Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts\nwithin the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even\nwith malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we\nhave explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and\nARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a\nthorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies,\nperformance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose.\nIn addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible\nweaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on\nthe central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security\ninfrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation\nfor Confidential Computing.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04550v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.1002, "topK": [{"title": "MEDL-U: Uncertainty-aware 3D Automatic Annotation based on Evidential\n  Deep

{"title": "Jr. AI Scientist and Its Risk Report: Autonomous Scientific Exploration\n  from a Baseline Paper", "author": "Atsuyuki Miyai and Mashiro Toyooka and Takashi Otonari and Zaiying Zhao and Kiyoharu Aizawa", "abstract": "  Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is\nessential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific\nprogress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,\nwe develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system\nthat mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given\nthe baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,\nformulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous\nexperimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous\napproaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI\nScientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding\nagents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically\nvaluable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments\nusing AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,\na venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings\ndemonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review\nscores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify\nimportant limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science\nreviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI\nScientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we\ncomprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope\nthese insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI\nScientist development.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04583v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy":

{"title": "CREA: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Creative Image Editing\n  and Generation", "author": "Kavana Venkatesh and Connor Dunlop and Pinar Yanardag", "abstract": "  Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only\nthe generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add\nnovel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike\nconventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications,\ncreative image editing requires an autonomous, iterative approach that balances\noriginality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce\nCREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human\ncreative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who\ndynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance\nimages. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we\ndemonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\ndiversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05306v2", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.1556, "topK":

{"title": "Speed at the Cost of Quality? The Impact of LLM Agent Assistance on\n  Software Development", "author": "Hao He and Courtney Miller and Shyam Agarwal and Christian K\u00e4stner and Bogdan Vasilescu", "abstract": "  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize\nthe field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly\ngaining momentum in their application to software development, with\npractitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet,\nempirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate\nthe causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely\nCursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled\nby a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing\nCursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub\nprojects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a\nsignificant, large, but transient increase in project-level development\nvelocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis\nwarnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments\nestimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code\ncomplexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our\nstudy carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent\nassistant designers, and researchers.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427v1", "date": "2025-11-06",

In particular, it is investigating and\ncomparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the\nnumber of sampling steps. In this regard, it compares direct distillation,\nprogressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs\nand rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of\nchallenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly\npredicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for\nefficient inflow generation for solvers.\n", "link":

{"title": "Data-driven uncertainty-aware seakeeping prediction of the Delft 372\n  catamaran using ensemble Hankel dynamic mode decomposition", "author": "Giorgio Palma and Andrea Serani and Matteo Diez", "abstract": "  In this study, we present and validate an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition with control (HDMDc) for uncertainty-aware seakeeping predictions\nof a high-speed catamaran, namely the Delft 372 model. Experimental\nmeasurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of\ngravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge\nacceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin\ntests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5\nconditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test\nsets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order\nmodel of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their\ntime-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling\nstrategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters\nconsidered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior\nmean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which\naggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing\nseakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is\nfound to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic\ncounterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the\napplication of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in\ncomparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density\nfunctions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS\nresults, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping\nprediction for design and operational support.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04461v1", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.4133, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to Feel It To Believe It: Multi-Modal

Our work reveals a close connection\nbetween the modified version of IMF and the Iterative Proportional Fitting\n(IPF) procedure -- a foundational method for the SB problem, also known as\nSinkhorn's algorithm. Specifically, we demonstrate that the heuristic\nmodification of the IMF effectively integrates both IMF and IPF procedures. We\nrefer to this combined approach as the Iterative Proportional Markovian Fitting\n(IPMF) procedure. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we establish the\nconvergence of the IPMF procedure under various settings, contributing to\ndeveloping a unified framework for solving SB problems. Moreover, from a\npractical standpoint, the IPMF procedure enables a flexible trade-off between\nimage similarity and generation quality, offering a new mechanism for tailoring\nmodels to specific tasks.\n", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02601v4", "date": "2025-11-06", "relevancy": 1.0401, "topK": [{"title": "Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis", "link":
