{"title": "Learning High-Fidelity Cloth Animation via Skinning-Free Image Transfer", "author": "Rong Wang and Wei Mao and Changsheng Lu and Hongdong Li", "abstract": "We present a novel method for generating 3D garment deformations from given body poses, which is key to a wide range of applications, including virtual try-on and extended reality. To simplify the cloth dynamics, existing methods mostly rely on linear blend skinning to obtain low-frequency posed garment shape and only regress high-frequency wrinkles. However, due to the lack of explicit skinning supervision, such skinning-based approach often produces misaligned shapes when posing the garment, consequently corrupts the high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles. To tackle this issue, we propose a skinning-free approach by independently estimating posed (i) vertex position for low-frequency posed garment shape, and (ii) vertex normal for high-frequency local wrinkle details. In this way, each frequency modality can be effectively decoupled and directly supervised by the geometry of the deformed garment. To further improve the visual quality of animation, we propose to encode both vertex attributes as rendered texture images, so that 3D garment deformation can be equivalently achieved via 2D image transfer. This enables us to leverage powerful pretrained image models to recover fine-grained visual details in wrinkles, while maintaining superior scalability for garments of diverse topologies without relying on manual UV partition. Finally, we propose a multimodal fusion to incorporate constraints from both frequency modalities and robustly recover deformed 3D garments from transferred images. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves animation quality on various garment types and recovers finer wrinkles than state-of-the-art methods.", "link":

{"title": "3D Question Answering via only 2D Vision-Language Models", "author": "Fengyun Wang and Sicheng Yu and Jiawei Wu and Jinhui Tang and Hanwang Zhang and Qianru Sun", "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced numerous fields. In this work, we explore how to harness their potential to address 3D scene understanding tasks, using 3D question answering (3D-QA) as a representative example. Due to the limited training data in 3D, we do not train LVLMs but infer in a zero-shot manner. Specifically, we sample 2D views from a 3D point cloud and feed them into 2D models to answer a given question. When the 2D model is chosen, e.g., LLAVA-OV, the quality of sampled views matters the most. We propose cdViews, a novel approach to automatically selecting critical and diverse Views for 3D-QA. cdViews consists of two key components: viewSelector prioritizing critical views based on their potential to provide answer-specific information, and viewNMS enhancing diversity by removing redundant views based on spatial overlap. We evaluate cdViews on the widely-used ScanQA and SQA benchmarks, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D-QA while relying solely on 2D models without fine-tuning. These findings support our belief that 2D LVLMs are currently the most effective alternative (of the resource-intensive 3D LVLMs) for addressing 3D tasks.", "link":

{"title": "Multi-Modal Data-Efficient 3D Scene Understanding for Autonomous Driving", "author": "Lingdong Kong and Xiang Xu and Jiawei Ren and Wenwei Zhang and Liang Pan and Kai Chen and Wei Tsang Ooi and Ziwei Liu", "abstract": "Efficient data utilization is crucial for advancing 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving, where reliance on heavily human-annotated LiDAR point clouds challenges fully supervised methods. Addressing this, our study extends into semi-supervised learning for LiDAR semantic segmentation, leveraging the intrinsic spatial priors of driving scenes and multi-sensor complements to augment the efficacy of unlabeled datasets. We introduce LaserMix++, an evolved framework that integrates laser beam manipulations from disparate LiDAR scans and incorporates LiDAR-camera correspondences to further assist data-efficient learning. Our framework is tailored to enhance 3D scene consistency regularization by incorporating multi-modality, including 1) multi-modal LaserMix operation for fine-grained cross-sensor interactions; 2) camera-to-LiDAR feature distillation that enhances LiDAR feature learning; and 3) language-driven knowledge guidance generating auxiliary supervisions using open-vocabulary models. The versatility of LaserMix++ enables applications across LiDAR representations, establishing it as a universally applicable solution. Our framework is rigorously validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on popular driving perception datasets. Results demonstrate that LaserMix++ markedly outperforms fully supervised alternatives, achieving comparable accuracy with five times fewer annotations and significantly improving the supervised-only baselines. This substantial advancement underscores the potential of semi-supervised approaches in reducing the reliance on extensive labeled data in LiDAR-based 3D scene understanding systems.", "link":

{"title": "Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning with Selective Perceptual Modeling", "author": "Shuai Dong and Siyuan Wang and Xingyu Liu and Zhongyu Wei", "abstract": "Interleaved reasoning paradigms enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual feedback but are hindered by the prohibitive computational cost of repeatedly re-encoding pixel-dense images. A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet currently forces a critical trade-off: methods either sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features or fail to model dynamic problems due to static, non-interleaved structures. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05665v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.9738, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex

Most existing methods are either inefficient or less straightforward for predicting the position of 3D mesh vertices. Thus, we propose a new pipeline called Monocular 3D Hand Mesh Recovery (M3DHMR) to directly estimate the positions of hand mesh vertices. M3DHMR provides 2D cues for 3D tasks from a single image and uses a new spiral decoder consist of several Dynamic Spiral Convolution (DSC) Layers and a Region of Interest (ROI) Layer. On the one hand, DSC Layers adaptively adjust the weights based on the vertex positions and extract the vertex features in both spatial and channel dimensions. On the other hand, ROI Layer utilizes the physical information and refines mesh vertices in each predefined hand region separately. Extensive experiments on popular dataset FreiHAND demonstrate that M3DHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art real-time methods.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20058v2", "date":

{"title": "Point-PNG: Conditional Pseudo-Negatives Generation for Point Cloud Pre-Training", "author": "Sutharsan Mahendren and Saimunur Rahman and Piotr Koniusz and Tharindu Fernando and Sridha Sridharan and Clinton Fookes and Peyman Moghadam", "abstract": "We propose Point-PNG, a novel self-supervised learning framework that generates conditional pseudo-negatives in the latent space to learn point cloud representations that are both discriminative and transformation-sensitive. Conventional self-supervised learning methods focus on achieving invariance, discarding transformation-specific information. Recent approaches incorporate transformation sensitivity by explicitly modeling relationships between original and transformed inputs. However, they often suffer from an invariant-collapse phenomenon, where the predictor degenerates into identity mappings, resulting in latent representations with limited variation across transformations. To address this, we propose Point-PNG that explicitly penalizes invariant collapse through pseudo-negatives generation, enabling the network to capture richer transformation cues while preserving discriminative representations. To this end, we introduce a parametric network, COnditional Pseudo-Negatives Embedding (COPE), which learns localized displacements induced by transformations within the latent space. A key challenge arises when jointly training COPE with the MAE, as it tends to converge to trivial identity mappings. To overcome this, we design a loss function based on pseudo-negatives conditioned on the transformation, which penalizes such trivial invariant solutions and enforces meaningful representation learning. We validate Point-PNG on shape classification and relative pose estimation tasks, showing competitive performance on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN under challenging evaluation protocols, and achieving superior accuracy in relative pose estimation compared to supervised baselines.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15832v3", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.9354, "topK": [{"title": "IAE:

{"title": "Manifold-Aware Point Cloud Completion via Geodesic-Attentive Hierarchical Feature Learning", "author": "Jianan Sun and Dongzhihan Wang and Mingyu Fan", "abstract": "Point cloud completion seeks to recover geometrically consistent shapes from partial or sparse 3D observations. Although recent methods have achieved reasonable global shape reconstruction, they often rely on Euclidean proximity and overlook the intrinsic nonlinear geometric structure of point clouds, resulting in suboptimal geometric consistency and semantic ambiguity. In this paper, we present a manifold-aware point cloud completion framework that explicitly incorporates nonlinear geometry information throughout the feature learning pipeline. Our approach introduces two key modules: a Geodesic Distance Approximator (GDA), which estimates geodesic distances between points to capture the latent manifold topology, and a Manifold-Aware Feature Extractor (MAFE), which utilizes geodesic-based $k$-NN groupings and a geodesic-relational attention mechanism to guide the hierarchical feature extraction process. By integrating geodesic-aware relational attention, our method promotes semantic coherence and structural fidelity in the reconstructed point clouds. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05710v1",

We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17101v4", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.8542,

{"title": "REVISOR: Beyond Textual Reflection, Towards Multimodal Introspective Reasoning in Long-Form Video Understanding", "author": "Jiaze Li and Hao Yin and Wenhui Tan and Jingyang Chen and Boshen Xu and Yuxun Qu and Yijing Chen and Jianzhong Ju and Zhenbo Luo and Jian Luan", "abstract": "Self-reflection mechanisms that rely on purely text-based rethinking processes perform well in most multimodal tasks. However, when directly applied to long-form video understanding scenarios, they exhibit clear limitations. The fundamental reasons for this lie in two points: (1)long-form video understanding involves richer and more dynamic visual input, meaning rethinking only the text information is insufficient and necessitates a further rethinking process specifically targeting visual information; (2) purely text-based reflection mechanisms lack cross-modal interaction capabilities, preventing them from fully integrating visual information during reflection. Motivated by these insights, we propose REVISOR (REflective VIsual Segment Oriented Reasoning), a novel framework for tool-augmented multimodal reflection. REVISOR enables MLLMs to collaboratively construct introspective reflection processes across textual and visual modalities, significantly enhancing their reasoning capability for long-form video understanding. To ensure that REVISOR can learn to accurately review video segments highly relevant to the question during reinforcement learning, we designed the Dual Attribution Decoupled Reward (DADR) mechanism. Integrated into the GRPO training strategy, this mechanism enforces causal alignment between the model's reasoning and the selected video evidence. Notably, the REVISOR framework significantly enhances long-form video understanding capability of MLLMs without requiring supplementary supervised fine-tuning or external models, achieving impressive results on four benchmarks including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and LVBench.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13026v2", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.8321, "topK": [{"title":

{"title": "EMMA: Efficient Multimodal Understanding, Generation, and Editing with a Unified Architecture", "author": "Xin He and Longhui Wei and Jianbo Ouyang and Lingxi Xie and Qi Tian", "abstract": "We propose EMMA, an efficient and unified architecture for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Specifically, EMMA primarily consists of 1) An efficient autoencoder with a 32x compression ratio, which significantly reduces the number of tokens required for generation. This also ensures the training balance between understanding and generation tasks by applying the same compression ratio to images. 2) Channel-wise concatenation instead of token-wise concatenation among visual understanding and generation tokens, which further reduces the visual tokens in unified architectures. 3) A shared-and-decoupled network that enables mutual improvements across tasks while meeting the task-specific modeling requirements. 4) A mixture-of-experts mechanism adopted for visual understanding encoder, which substantially improves perceptual capabilities with a few parameters increase. Extensive experiments have shown that EMMA-4B can significantly outperform state-of-the-art unified multimodal approaches (e.g., BAGEL-7B) in both efficiency and performance, while also achieving competitive results compared to recent multimodal understanding and generation experts (e.g., Qwen3-VL and Qwen-Image). We believe that EMMA lays a solid foundation for the future development of unified multimodal architectures.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04810v2", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.8288,

{"title": "Deep Learning-Based Real-Time Sequential Facial Expression Analysis Using Geometric Features", "author": "Talha Enes Koksal and Abdurrahman Gumus", "abstract": "Facial expression recognition is a crucial component in enhancing human-computer interaction and developing emotion-aware systems. Real-time detection and interpretation of facial expressions have become increasingly important for various applications, from user experience personalization to intelligent surveillance systems. This study presents a novel approach to real-time sequential facial expression recognition using deep learning and geometric features. The proposed method utilizes MediaPipe FaceMesh for rapid and accurate facial landmark detection. Geometric features, including Euclidean distances and angles, are extracted from these landmarks. Temporal dynamics are incorporated by analyzing feature differences between consecutive frames, enabling the detection of onset, apex, and offset phases of expressions. For classification, a ConvLSTM1D network followed by multilayer perceptron blocks is employed. The method's performance was evaluated on multiple publicly available datasets, including CK+, Oulu-CASIA (VIS and NIR), and MMI. Accuracies of 93%, 79%, 77%, and 68% were achieved respectively. Experiments with composite datasets were also conducted to assess the model's generalization capabilities. The approach demonstrated real-time applicability, processing approximately 165 frames per second on consumer-grade hardware. This research contributes to the field of facial expression analysis by providing a fast, accurate, and adaptable solution. The findings highlight the potential for further advancements in emotion-aware technologies and personalized user experiences, paving the way for more sophisticated human-computer interaction systems.

{"title": "3D Path Planning for Robot-assisted Vertebroplasty from Arbitrary Bi-plane X-ray via Differentiable Rendering", "author": "Blanca Inigo and Benjamin D. Killeen and Rebecca Choi and Michelle Song and Ali Uneri and Majid Khan and Christopher Bailey and Axel Krieger and Mathias Unberath", "abstract": "Robotic systems are transforming image-guided interventions by enhancing accuracy and minimizing radiation exposure. A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05803v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.7318, "topK": [{"title": "Egocentric Computer Vision for Hands-Free Robotic Wheelchair Navigation",

We introduce a self-supervised approach for detecting AI-generated images that leverages camera metadata -- specifically exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags -- to learn features intrinsic to digital photography. Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\\eg, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05651v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.7241, "topK": [{"title": "Magic-Me: Identity-Specific Video

Standard final-answer evaluation often masks reasoning errors, allowing silent failures to persist. To address this gap, we introduce TRACE, a framework for Transparent Reasoning And Consistency Evaluation that diagnoses reasoning trajectories rather than only end results. At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation. Our experiments show that consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint the reasoning steps where failures arise, offering actionable signals for model improvement. Furthermore, TRACE defines confidence regions that distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement.", "link":

{"title": "Self-Supervised Learning of Graph Representations for Network Intrusion Detection", "author": "Lorenzo Guerra and Thomas Chapuis and Guillaume Duc and Pavlo Mozharovskyi and Van-Tam Nguyen", "abstract": "Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16625v4",

{"title": "Open-PMC-18M: A High-Fidelity Large Scale Medical Dataset for Multimodal Representation Learning", "author": "Negin Baghbanzadeh and Mohammed Saidul Islam and Sajad Ashkezari and Elham Dolatabadi and Arash Afkanpour", "abstract": "In biomedical vision-language modeling, datasets are typically mined from scientific literature, pairing compound figures with captions that are short, context-dependent, and oftern partially informative. Prior work on subfigure extraction has been limited in both dataset size and generalizability. In addition, no existing effort has incorporated rich medical context in image-text pairs. We revisit data curation as a foundational component of effective biomedical representation learning. Our data curation process integrates transformer-based subfigure detection, subcaption extraction, and contextual text enrichment derived from inline references. Our subfigure extraction model, trained on a corpus of 500,000 compound figures, achieves state-of-the-art performance on real and synthetic benchmarks. Using this process, we curate and release Open-PMC-18M, a large-scale high-fidelity biomedical dataset comprising 18 million image-text pairs, spanning radiology, microscopy, and visible light photography. We train vision-language models on our dataset and perform extensive evaluation on 6 retrieval and 19 zero-shot classification tasks across three major modalities. The models trained on our dataset set a new state-of-the-art results in medical representation learning. We release our dataset, models, and code to support reproducible benchmarks and further study into biomedical vision-language modeling and representation learning.", "link":

NormalView embeds local geometric information into two-dimensional projections, in the form of normal vector estimates, and uses the projections as inputs to an image classification network, YOLOv11. In addition, we inspected the effect of multispectral radiometric intensity information on classification performance. We trained and tested our model on high-density MLS data (7 species, ~5000 pts/m^2), as well as high-density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data (9 species, >1000 pts/m^2). On the MLS data, NormalView achieves an overall accuracy (macro-average accuracy) of 95.5 % (94.8 %), and 91.8 % (79.1 %) on the ALS data. We found that having intensity information from multiple scanners provides benefits in tree species classification, and the best model on the multispectral ALS dataset was a model using intensity information from all three channels of the multispectral ALS. This study demonstrates that projection-based methods, when enhanced with geometric information and coupled with state-of-the-art image classification backbones, can achieve exceptional results. Crucially, these methods are sensor-agnostic, relying only on geometric information. Additionally, we publically release the MLS dataset used in the study.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05610v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.6659, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing

Within this context, steering is by design performed by means of decoding altered SAE intermediate representations. This procedure essentially rewrites the original activations as a weighted sum of decoder features. In contrast to existing literature, we forward an encoder-centric alternative to model steering which demonstrates a stronger cross-modal performance. We introduce S&P Top-K, a retraining-free and computationally lightweight Selection and Projection framework that identifies Top-K encoder features aligned with a sensitive attribute or behavior, optionally aggregates them into a single control axis, and computes an orthogonal projection to be subsequently applied directly in the model's native embedding space. In vision-language models, it improves fairness metrics on CelebA and FairFace by up to 3.2 times over conventional SAE usage, and in large language models, it substantially reduces aggressiveness and sycophancy in Llama-3 8B Instruct, achieving up to 3.6 times gains over masked reconstruction. These findings suggest that encoder-centric interventions provide a general, efficient, and more effective mechanism for shaping model behavior at inference time than the traditional decoder-centric use of SAEs.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10809v2", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.6648, "topK": [{"title": "IAE: Implicit Autoencoder for Point Cloud Self-supervised Representation

{"title": "Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning", "author": "Ziwen Wang and Jiajun Fan and Thao Nguyen and Heng Ji and Ge Liu", "abstract": "Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization. To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space. Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation strategies.

Despite the proliferation of deep neural network architectures for segmentation and phenotyping of 3D plant models in the last decade, the amount of data, and diversity in terms of species and data acquisition modalities are far from sufficient for evaluation of such tools for their generalization ability. To contribute to closing this gap, we introduce PLANesT-3D; a new annotated dataset of 3D color point clouds of plants. PLANesT-3D is composed of 34 point cloud models representing 34 real plants from three different plant species: \\textit{Capsicum annuum}, \\textit{Rosa kordana}, and \\textit{Ribes rubrum}. Both semantic labels in terms of \"leaf\" and \"stem\", and organ instance labels were manually annotated for the full point clouds. PLANesT-3D introduces diversity to existing datasets by adding point clouds of two new species and providing 3D data acquired with the low-cost SfM/MVS technique as opposed to laser scanning or expensive setups. Point clouds reconstructed with SfM/MVS modality exhibit challenges such as missing data, variable density, and illumination variations. As an additional contribution, SP-LSCnet, a novel semantic segmentation method that is a combination of unsupervised superpoint extraction and a 3D point-based deep learning approach is introduced and evaluated on the new dataset. The advantages of SP-LSCnet over other deep learning methods are its modular structure and increased interpretability. Two existing deep neural network architectures, PointNet++ and RoseSegNet, were also tested on the point clouds of PLANesT-3D for semantic segmentation.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21150v2",

Existing approaches can transfer motion from a driving video to a reference image, but often fail to preserve structural fidelity and temporal consistency in wild scenarios involving complex motion and cross-identity animations. In this work, we present \\textbf{SCAIL} (\\textbf{S}tudio-grade \\textbf{C}haracter \\textbf{A}nimation via \\textbf{I}n-context \\textbf{L}earning), a framework designed to address these challenges from two key innovations. First, we propose a novel 3D pose representation, providing a more robust and flexible motion signal. Second, we introduce a full-context pose injection mechanism within a diffusion-transformer architecture, enabling effective spatio-temporal reasoning over full motion sequences. To align with studio-level requirements, we develop a curated data pipeline ensuring both diversity and quality, and establish a comprehensive benchmark for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that \\textbf{SCAIL} achieves state-of-the-art performance and advances character animation toward studio-grade reliability and realism.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05905v1",

N. Le and Zhu Han and Chandra Mohan and Hien Van Nguyen", "abstract": "Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology reduces pixel-level labeling by learning from image-level labels, but it is hindered by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and CAM-induced region shrinkage (global pooling-based class activation maps whose activations highlight only the most distinctive areas and miss nearby class regions). Recent works address these challenges by constructing a clustering prototype bank and then refining masks in a separate stage; however, such two-stage pipelines are costly, sensitive to hyperparameters, and decouple prototype discovery from segmentation learning, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a cluster-free, one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization to enhance morphological intra-class heterogeneity coverage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on BCSS-WSSS, outperforming prior methods in mIoU and mDice. Qualitative segmentation maps show sharper boundaries and fewer mislabels, and activation heatmaps further reveal that, compared with clustering-based prototypes, our learnable prototypes cover more diverse and complementary regions within each class, providing consistent qualitative evidence for their effectiveness.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05922v1", "date": "2025-12-05",

{"title": "Neural Coherence : Find higher performance to out-of-distribution tasks from few samples", "author": "Simon Guiroy and Mats Richter and Sarath Chandar and Christopher Pal", "abstract": "To create state-of-the-art models for many downstream tasks, it has become common practice to fine-tune a pre-trained large vision model. However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines. We further demonstrate the versatility of Neural Coherence as a powerful principle by showing its effectiveness in training data selection.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05880v1", "date":

{"title": "Bring Your Dreams to Life: Continual Text-to-Video Customization", "author": "Jiahua Dong and Xudong Wang and Wenqi Liang and Zongyan Han and Meng Cao and Duzhen Zhang and Hanbin Zhao and Zhi Han and Salman Khan and Fahad Shahbaz Khan", "abstract": "Customized text-to-video generation (CTVG) has recently witnessed great progress in generating tailored videos from user-specific text. However, most CTVG methods assume that personalized concepts remain static and do not expand incrementally over time. Additionally, they struggle with forgetting and concept neglect when continuously learning new concepts, including subjects and motions. To resolve the above challenges, we develop a novel Continual Customized Video Diffusion (CCVD) model, which can continuously learn new concepts to generate videos across various text-to-video generation tasks by tackling forgetting and concept neglect. To address catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a concept-specific attribute retention module and a task-aware concept aggregation strategy. They can capture the unique characteristics and identities of old concepts during training, while combining all subject and motion adapters of old concepts based on their relevance during testing. Besides, to tackle concept neglect, we develop a controllable conditional synthesis to enhance regional features and align video contexts with user conditions, by incorporating layer-specific region attention-guided noise estimation. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that our CCVD outperforms existing CTVG models.

{"title": "Variational Learning of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models through Stochastic Gradient Annealed Importance Sampling", "author": "Jian Xu and Shian Du and Junmei Yang and Qianli Ma and Delu Zeng", "abstract": "Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) have become increasingly popular for unsupervised tasks such as dimensionality reduction and missing data recovery due to their flexibility and non-linear nature. An importance-weighted version of the Bayesian GPLVMs has been proposed to obtain a tighter variational bound. However, this version of the approach is primarily limited to analyzing simple data structures, as the generation of an effective proposal distribution can become quite challenging in high-dimensional spaces or with complex data sets. In this work, we propose an Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) approach to address these issues. By transforming the posterior into a sequence of intermediate distributions using annealing, we combine the strengths of Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and VI to explore a wider range of posterior distributions and gradually approach the target distribution. We further propose an efficient algorithm by reparameterizing all variables in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Experimental results on both toy and image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of tighter variational bounds, higher log-likelihoods, and more robust convergence.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06710v2", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.6241, "topK": [{"title": "Dynamic Gaussians Mesh: Consistent Mesh Reconstruction from Monocular\n

{"title": "Morphling: Fast, Fused, and Flexible GNN Training at Scale", "author": " Anubhab and Rupesh Nasre", "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs, 19X on GPUs, and 6X in distributed settings over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed

{"title": "SAGE: Saliency-Guided Contrastive Embeddings", "author": "Colton R. Crum and Christopher Sweet and Adam Czajka", "abstract": "Integrating human perceptual priors into the training of neural networks has been shown to raise model generalization, serve as an effective regularizer, and align models with human expertise for applications in high-risk domains. Existing approaches to integrate saliency into model training often rely on internal model mechanisms, which recent research suggests may be unreliable. Our insight is that many challenges associated with saliency-guided training stem from the placement of the guidance approaches solely within the image space. Instead, we move away from the image space, use the model's latent space embeddings to steer human guidance during training, and we propose SAGE (Saliency-Guided Contrastive Embeddings): a loss function that integrates human saliency into network training using contrastive embeddings. We apply salient-preserving and saliency-degrading signal augmentations to the input and capture the changes in embeddings and model logits. We guide the model towards salient features and away from non-salient features using a contrastive triplet loss. Additionally, we perform a sanity check on the logit distributions to ensure that the model outputs match the saliency-based augmentations. We demonstrate a boost in classification performance across both open- and closed-set scenarios against SOTA saliency-based methods, showing SAGE's effectiveness across various backbones, and include experiments to suggest its wide generalization across tasks.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12744v2", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.5511, "topK": [{"title": "UGG: Unified Generative

{"title": "FNOPT: Resolution-Agnostic, Self-Supervised Cloth Simulation using Meta-Optimization with Fourier Neural Operators", "author": "Ruochen Chen and Thuy Tran and Shaifali Parashar", "abstract": "We present FNOpt, a self-supervised cloth simulation framework that formulates time integration as an optimization problem and trains a resolution-agnostic neural optimizer parameterized by a Fourier neural operator (FNO). Prior neural simulators often rely on extensive ground truth data or sacrifice fine-scale detail, and generalize poorly across resolutions and motion patterns. In contrast, FNOpt learns to simulate physically plausible cloth dynamics and achieves stable and accurate rollouts across diverse mesh resolutions and motion patterns without retraining. Trained only on a coarse grid with physics-based losses, FNOpt generalizes to finer resolutions, capturing fine-scale wrinkles and preserving rollout stability. Extensive evaluations on a benchmark cloth simulation dataset demonstrate that FNOpt outperforms prior learning-based approaches in out-of-distribution settings in both accuracy and robustness. These results position FNO-based meta-optimization as a compelling alternative to previous neural simulators for cloth, thus reducing the need for curated data and improving cross-resolution

{"title": "NICE: Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model for Orthognathic Surgery Prediction", "author": "Jiawen Yang and Yihui Cao and Xuanyu Tian and Yuyao Zhang and Hongjiang Wei", "abstract": "Orthognathic surgery is a crucial intervention for correcting dentofacial skeletal deformities to enhance occlusal functionality and facial aesthetics. Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction remains challenging due to the complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions such as lips and chin, while robustly preserving anatomical integrity. This work provides a clinically viable tool for enhanced surgical planning and patient consultation in orthognathic procedures.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05920v1", "date": "2025-12-05",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this limitation by enabling access to up-to-date, culturally grounded, and multilingual information; however, multilingual multimodal RAG remains largely underexplored. We introduce M4-RAG, a massive-scale benchmark covering 42 languages and 56 regional dialects and registers, comprising over 80,000 culturally diverse image-question pairs for evaluating retrieval-augmented VQA across languages and modalities. To balance realism with reproducibility, we build a controlled retrieval environment containing millions of carefully curated multilingual documents relevant to the query domains, approximating real-world retrieval conditions while ensuring consistent experimentation. Our systematic evaluation reveals that although RAG consistently benefits smaller VLMs, it fails to scale to larger models and often even degrades their performance, exposing a critical mismatch between model size and current retrieval effectiveness.

{"title": "Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network with Frequency-Aware Learning for Optical Aberration Correction", "author": "Yong En Kok and Bowen Deng and Alexander Bentley and Andrew J. Parkes and Michael G. Somekh and Amanda J. Wright and Michael P. Pound", "abstract": "Optical aberrations significantly degrade image quality in microscopy, particularly when imaging deeper into samples. These aberrations arise from distortions in the optical wavefront and can be mathematically represented using Zernike polynomials. Existing methods often address only mild aberrations on limited sample types and modalities, typically treating the problem as a black-box mapping without leveraging the underlying optical physics of wavefront distortions. We propose ZRNet, a physics-informed framework that jointly performs Zernike coefficient prediction and optical image Restoration. We contribute a Zernike Graph module that explicitly models physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on their azimuthal degrees-ensuring that learned corrections align with fundamental optical principles. To further enforce physical consistency between image restoration and Zernike prediction, we introduce a Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss, which better aligns Zernike coefficient prediction and image features in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on CytoImageNet demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations.

Initially, the ResNet architecture was reformulated as a cyclic tridiagonal LMI, and closed-form constraints on network parameters were derived to ensure $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity; however, using a new $LDL^\\top$ decomposition approach for certifying LMI feasibility, we extend the construction of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipchitz networks to any other nonlinear architecture. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained residual networks and other hierarchical architectures. Cholesky decomposition is also used for efficient parameterization. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems. The $LDL^\\top$ formulation is shown to be a tight relaxation of the SDP-based network, maintaining full expressiveness and achieving 3\\%-13\\% accuracy gains over SLL Layers on 121 UCI data sets.",

Existing approaches either rely on LiDAR or geometric priors to compensate for missing depth, or sacrifice efficiency to achieve competitive accuracy. We introduce LeAD-M3D, a monocular 3D detector that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference without extra modalities. Our method is powered by three key components. Asymmetric Augmentation Denoising Distillation (A2D2) transfers geometric knowledge from a clean-image teacher to a mixup-noised student via a quality- and importance-weighted depth-feature loss, enabling stronger depth reasoning without LiDAR supervision. 3D-aware Consistent Matching (CM3D) improves prediction-to-ground truth assignment by integrating 3D MGIoU into the matching score, yielding more stable and precise supervision. Finally, Confidence-Gated 3D Inference (CGI3D) accelerates detection by restricting expensive 3D regression to top-confidence regions. Together, these components set a new Pareto frontier for monocular 3D detection: LeAD-M3D achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI and Waymo, and the best reported car AP on Rope3D, while running up to 3.6x faster than prior high-accuracy methods. Our results demonstrate that high fidelity and real-time efficiency in monocular 3D detection are simultaneously attainable - without LiDAR, stereo, or geometric assumptions.", "link":

{"title": "InverseCrafter: Efficient Video ReCapture as a Latent Domain Inverse Problem", "author": "Yeobin Hong and Suhyeon Lee and Hyungjin Chung and Jong Chul Ye", "abstract": "Recent approaches to controllable 4D video generation often rely on fine-tuning pre-trained Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). This dominant paradigm is computationally expensive, requiring large-scale datasets and architectural modifications, and frequently suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the model's original generative priors. Here, we propose InverseCrafter, an efficient inpainting inverse solver that reformulates the 4D generation task as an inpainting problem solved in the latent space. The core of our method is a principled mechanism to encode the pixel space degradation operator into a continuous, multi-channel latent mask, thereby bypassing the costly bottleneck of repeated VAE operations and backpropagation. InverseCrafter not only achieves comparable novel view generation and superior measurement consistency in camera control tasks with near-zero computational overhead, but also excels at general-purpose video inpainting with editing.

{"title": "Concept-Guided Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models", "author": "Haoyu Shen and Weimin Lyu and Haotian Xu and Tengfei Ma", "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal text generation, yet their rapid adoption raises increasing concerns about security vulnerabilities. Existing backdoor attacks against VLMs primarily rely on explicit pixel-level triggers or imperceptible perturbations injected into images. While effective, these approaches reduce stealthiness and remain vulnerable to image-based defenses. We introduce concept-guided backdoor attacks, a new paradigm that operates at the semantic concept level rather than on raw pixels. We propose two different attacks. The first, Concept-Thresholding Poisoning (CTP), uses explicit concepts in natural images as triggers: only samples containing the target concept are poisoned, causing the model to behave normally in all other cases but consistently inject malicious outputs whenever the concept appears. The second, CBL-Guided Unseen Backdoor (CGUB), leverages a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) during training to intervene on internal concept activations, while discarding the CBM branch at inference time to keep the VLM unchanged. This design enables systematic replacement of a targeted label in generated text (for example, replacing \"cat\" with \"dog\"), even when the replacement behavior never appears in the training data.

{"title": "IPA: An Information-Reconstructive Input Projection Framework for Efficient Foundation Model Adaptation", "author": "Yuan Yin and Shashanka Venkataramanan and Tuan-Hung Vu and Andrei Bursuc and Matthieu Cord", "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However, LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly aims to reconstruct the original input within a reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable parameters when the projection is frozen.

{"title": "CodeNER: Code Prompting for Named Entity Recognition", "author": "Sungwoo Han and Jingun Kwon and Hidetaka Kamigaito and Manabu Okumura", "abstract": "Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition (NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels, they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly, ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts, we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting further improves performance.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20423v2", "date":

While recent approaches using autoregressive and diffusion-based models have achieved notable progress, they often suffer from modality inconsistencies, particularly misalignment between audio and mesh, leading to reduced motion diversity and lip-sync accuracy. To address this, we propose GLDiTalker, a novel speech-driven 3D facial animation model based on a Graph Latent Diffusion Transformer. GLDiTalker resolves modality misalignment by diffusing signals within a quantized spatiotemporal latent space. It employs a two-stage training pipeline: the Graph-Enhanced Quantized Space Learning Stage ensures lip-sync accuracy, while the Space-Time Powered Latent Diffusion Stage enhances motion diversity. Together, these stages enable GLDiTalker to generate realistic, temporally stable 3D facial animations. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that GLDiTalker outperforms existing methods, achieving superior results in both lip-sync accuracy and motion diversity.", "link":

These methods may assign high attention weights to non-tumor regions, such as staining biases or artifacts, leading to unreliable tumor region localization. In this paper, we revisit max-pooling-based MIL methods from a causal perspective. Under mild assumptions, our theoretical results demonstrate that max-pooling encourages the model to focus on causal factors while ignoring bias-related factors. Furthermore, we discover that existing max-pooling-based methods may overfit the training set through rote memorization of instance features and fail to learn meaningful patterns. To address these issues, we propose FocusMIL, which couples max-pooling with an instance-level variational information bottleneck (VIB) to learn compact, predictive latent representations, and employs a multi-bag mini-batch scheme to stabilize optimization. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets and one semi-synthetic dataset. The results show that, by capturing causal factors, FocusMIL exhibits significant advantages in out-of-distribution scenarios and instance-level tumor region localization tasks.", "link":

{"title": "Efficient Text Classification with Conformal In-Context Learning", "author": "Ippokratis Pantelidis and Korbinian Randl and Aron Henriksson", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong in-context learning abilities, yet their effectiveness in text classification depends heavily on prompt design and incurs substantial computational cost. Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe) has been proposed as a resource-efficient framework that integrates a lightweight base classifier with Conformal Prediction to guide LLM prompting by adaptively reducing the set of candidate classes. However, its broader applicability and efficiency benefits beyond a single domain have not yet been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks. The results show that CICLe consistently improves over its base classifier and outperforms few-shot prompting baselines when the sample size is sufficient for training the base classifier, and performs comparably in low-data regimes. In terms of efficiency, CICLe reduces the number of shots and prompt length by up to 34.45% and 25.16%, respectively, and enables the use of smaller models with competitive performance. CICLe is furthermore particularly advantageous for text classification tasks with high class imbalance.

{"title": "Ontology Learning with LLMs: A Benchmark Study on Axiom Identification", "author": "Roos M. Bakker and Daan L. Di Scala and Maaike H. T. de Boer and Stephan A. Raaijmakers", "abstract": "Ontologies are an important tool for structuring domain knowledge, but their development is a complex task that requires significant modelling and domain expertise. Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05594v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.399, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D Scene\n

{"title": "Experts-Guided Unbalanced Optimal Transport for ISP Learning from Unpaired and/or Paired Data", "author": "Georgy Perevozchikov and Nancy Mehta and Egor Ershov and Radu Timofte", "abstract": "Learned Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines offer powerful end-to-end performance but are critically dependent on large-scale paired raw-to-sRGB datasets. This reliance on costly-to-acquire paired data remains a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel, unsupervised training framework based on Optimal Transport capable of training arbitrary ISP architectures in both unpaired and paired modes. We are the first to successfully apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) for this complex, cross-domain translation task. Our UOT-based framework provides robustness to outliers in the target sRGB data, allowing it to discount atypical samples that would be prohibitively costly to map. A key component of our framework is a novel ``committee of expert discriminators,'' a hybrid adversarial regularizer. This committee guides the optimal transport mapping by providing specialized, targeted gradients to correct specific ISP failure modes, including color fidelity, structural artifacts, and frequency-domain realism. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, we retrained existing state-of-the-art ISP architectures using our paired and unpaired setups. Our experiments show that while our framework, when trained in paired mode, exceeds the performance of the original paired methods across all metrics, our unpaired mode concurrently achieves quantitative and qualitative performance that rivals, and in some cases surpasses, the original paired-trained counterparts.

Deane", "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a mechanistic interpretability technique that have been used to provide insight into learned concepts within large protein language models. Here, we employ TopK and Ordered SAEs to investigate an autoregressive antibody language model, p-IgGen, and steer its generation. We show that TopK SAEs can reveal biologically meaningful latent features, but high feature concept correlation does not guarantee causal control over generation. In contrast, Ordered SAEs impose an hierarchical structure that reliably identifies steerable features, but at the expense of more complex and less interpretable activation patterns. These findings advance the mechanistic interpretability of domain-specific protein language models and suggest that, while TopK SAEs are sufficient for mapping latent features to concepts, Ordered SAEs are preferable when precise generative steering is required.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05794v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.3673, "topK": [{"title": "IAE: Implicit

{"title": "OWL: Unsupervised 3D Object Detection by Occupancy Guided Warm-up and Large Model Priors Reasoning", "author": "Xusheng Guo and Wanfa Zhang and Shijia Zhao and Qiming Xia and Xiaolong Xie and Mingming Wang and Hai Wu and Chenglu Wen", "abstract": "Unsupervised 3D object detection leverages heuristic algorithms to discover potential objects, offering a promising route to reduce annotation costs in autonomous driving. Existing approaches mainly generate pseudo labels and refine them through self-training iterations. However, these pseudo-labels are often incorrect at the beginning of training, resulting in misleading the optimization process. Moreover, effectively filtering and refining them remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose OWL for unsupervised 3D object detection by occupancy guided warm-up and large-model priors reasoning. OWL first employs an Occupancy Guided Warm-up (OGW) strategy to initialize the backbone weight with spatial perception capabilities, mitigating the interference of incorrect pseudo-labels on network convergence. Furthermore, OWL introduces an Instance-Cued Reasoning (ICR) module that leverages the prior knowledge of large models to assess pseudo-label quality, enabling precise filtering and refinement. Finally, we design a Weight-adapted Self-training (WAS) strategy to dynamically re-weight pseudo-labels, improving the performance through self-training.

{"title": "Dressing the Imagination: A Dataset for AI-Powered Translation of Text into Fashion Outfits and A Novel KAN Adapter for Enhanced Feature Adaptation", "author": "Gayatri Deshmukh and Somsubhra De and Chirag Sehgal and Jishu Sen Gupta and Sparsh Mittal", "abstract": "Specialized datasets that capture the fashion industry's rich language and styling elements can boost progress in AI-driven fashion design. We present FLORA, (Fashion Language Outfit Representation for Apparel Generation), the first comprehensive dataset containing 4,330 curated pairs of fashion outfits and corresponding textual descriptions. Each description utilizes industry-specific terminology and jargon commonly used by professional fashion designers, providing precise and detailed insights into the outfits. Hence, the dataset captures the delicate features and subtle stylistic elements necessary to create high-fidelity fashion designs.\n  We demonstrate that fine-tuning generative models on the FLORA dataset significantly enhances their capability to generate accurate and stylistically rich images from textual descriptions of fashion sketches. FLORA will catalyze the creation of advanced AI models capable of comprehending and producing subtle, stylistically rich fashion designs. It will also help fashion designers and end-users to bring their ideas to life.\n  As a second orthogonal contribution, we introduce NeRA (Nonlinear low-rank Expressive Representation Adapter), a novel adapter architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). Unlike traditional PEFT techniques such as LoRA, LoKR, DoRA, and LoHA that use MLP adapters, NeRA uses learnable spline-based nonlinear transformations, enabling superior modeling of complex semantic relationships, achieving strong fidelity, faster convergence and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on our proposed FLORA and LAION-5B datasets validate the superiority of NeRA over existing adapters.\n  We will open-source both the FLORA dataset and our implementation code.",

{"title": "Perspective-Invariant 3D Object Detection", "author": "Ao Liang and Lingdong Kong and Dongyue Lu and Youquan Liu and Jian Fang and Huaici Zhao and Wei Tsang Ooi", "abstract": "With the rise of robotics, LiDAR-based 3D object detection has garnered significant attention in both academia and industry. However, existing datasets and methods predominantly focus on vehicle-mounted platforms, leaving other autonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET, the first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations collected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby facilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well as cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel cross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the well-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves perspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric and feature levels. Additionally, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the resilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios, providing valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging cross-platform tasks, demonstrating substantial gains over existing adaptation methods. We hope this work paves the way for generalizable and unified 3D perception systems across diverse and complex environments. Our Pi3DET dataset, cross-platform benchmark suite, and annotation toolkit have been made publicly available.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17665v2", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.3326,

{"title": "STATE-NAV: Stability-Aware Traversability Estimation for Bipedal Navigation on Rough Terrain", "author": "Ziwon Yoon and Lawrence Y. Zhu and Jingxi Lu and Lu Gan and Ye Zhao", "abstract": "Bipedal robots have advantages in maneuvering human-centered environments, but face greater failure risk compared to other stable mobile platforms such as wheeled or quadrupedal robots. While learning-based traversability has been widely studied for these platforms, bipedal traversability has instead relied on manually designed rules with limited consideration of locomotion stability on rough terrain. In this work, we present the first learning-based traversability estimation and risk-sensitive navigation framework for bipedal robots operating in diverse, uneven environments. TravFormer, a transformer-based neural network, is trained to predict bipedal instability with uncertainty, enabling risk-aware and adaptive planning. Based on the network, we define traversability as stability-aware command velocity-the fastest command velocity that keeps instability below a user-defined limit. This velocity-based traversability is integrated into a hierarchical planner that combines traversability-informed Rapid Random Tree Star (TravRRT*) for time-efficient planning and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for safe execution. We validate our method in MuJoCo simulation and the real world, demonstrating improved navigation performance, with enhanced robustness and time efficiency across varying terrains compared to existing

{"title": "Label-Efficient Point Cloud Segmentation with Active Learning", "author": "Johannes Meyer and Jasper Hoffmann and Felix Schulz and Dominik Merkle and Daniel Buescher and Alexander Reiterer and Joschka Boedecker and Wolfram Burgard", "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud data often comes with high annotation costs. Active learning automates the process of selecting which data to annotate, reducing the total amount of annotation needed to achieve satisfactory performance. Recent approaches to active learning for 3D point clouds are often based on sophisticated heuristics for both, splitting point clouds into annotatable regions and selecting the most beneficial for further neural network training. In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement strategy to separate the point cloud into annotatable regions. In our approach, we utilize a 2D grid to subdivide the point cloud into columns. To identify the next data to be annotated, we employ a network ensemble to estimate the uncertainty in the network output. We evaluate our method on the S3DIS dataset, the Toronto-3D dataset, and a large-scale urban 3D point cloud of the city of Freiburg, which we labeled in parts manually. The extensive evaluation shows that our method yields performance on par with, or even better than, complex state-of-the-art methods on all datasets. Furthermore, we provide results suggesting that in the context of point clouds the annotated area can be a more meaningful measure for active learning algorithms than the number of annotated points.",

{"title": "HiMoE-VLA: Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policies", "author": "Zhiying Du and Bei Liu and Yaobo Liang and Yichao Shen and Haidong Cao and Xiangyu Zheng and Zhiyuan Feng and Zuxuan Wu and Jiaolong Yang and Yu-Gang Jiang", "abstract": "The development of foundation models for embodied intelligence critically depends on access to large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces.

{"title": "Active Video Perception: Iterative Evidence Seeking for Agentic Long Video Understanding", "author": "Ziyang Wang and Honglu Zhou and Shijie Wang and Junnan Li and Caiming Xiong and Silvio Savarese and Mohit Bansal and Michael S. Ryoo and Juan Carlos Niebles", "abstract": "Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05774v1", "date":

{"title": "SegAssess: Panoramic quality mapping for robust and transferable unsupervised segmentation assessment", "author": "Bingnan Yang and Mi Zhang and Zhili Zhang and Zhan Zhang and Yuanxin Zhao and Xiangyun Hu and Jianya Gong", "abstract": "High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth. Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF) module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks.

{"title": "Probing the effectiveness of World Models for Spatial Reasoning through Test-time Scaling", "author": "Saurav Jha and M. Jehanzeb Mirza and Wei Lin and Shiqi Yang and Sarath Chandar", "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain limited in spatial reasoning tasks that require multi-view understanding and embodied perspective shifts. Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

{"title": "AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM", "author": "Sunghyun Ahn and Youngwan Jo and Kijung Lee and Sein Kwon and Inpyo Hong and Sanghyun Park", "abstract": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets.

{"title": "Using Large Language Models to Create Personalized Networks From Therapy Sessions", "author": "Clarissa W. Ong and Hiba Arnaout and Kate Sheehan and Estella Fox and Eugen Owtscharow and Iryna Gurevych", "abstract": "Recent advances in psychotherapy have focused on treatment personalization, such as by selecting treatment modules based on personalized networks. However, estimating personalized networks typically requires intensive longitudinal data, which is not always feasible. A solution to facilitate scalability of network-driven treatment personalization is leveraging LLMs. In this study, we present an end-to-end pipeline for automatically generating client networks from 77 therapy transcripts to support case conceptualization and treatment planning. We annotated 3364 psychological processes and their corresponding dimensions in therapy transcripts. Using these data, we applied in-context learning to jointly identify psychological processes and their dimensions. The method achieved high performance even with a few training examples. To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach. In addition, the networks were rated favorably by experts, with scores for clinical relevance, novelty, and usefulness ranging from 72-75%. Our findings provide a proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts. Advantages of our approach include bottom-up case conceptualization from client utterances in therapy sessions and identification of latent themes. Networks generated from our pipeline may be used in clinical settings and supervision and training. Future research should examine whether these networks improve treatment outcomes relative to other methods of treatment personalization, including statistically estimated networks.", "link":

{"title": "Fast SceneScript: Accurate and Efficient Structured Language Model via Multi-Token Prediction", "author": "Ruihong Yin and Xuepeng Shi and Oleksandr Bailo and Marco Manfredi and Theo Gevers", "abstract": "Recent perception-generalist approaches based on language models have achieved state-of-the-art results across diverse tasks, including 3D scene layout estimation, via unified architecture and interface. However, these approaches rely on autoregressive next-token prediction, which is inherently slow. In this work, we introduce Fast SceneScript, a novel structured language model for accurate and efficient 3D scene layout estimation. Our method employs multi-token prediction (MTP) to reduce the number of autoregressive iterations and significantly accelerate inference. While MTP improves speed, unreliable token predictions can significantly reduce accuracy. To filter out unreliable tokens, we adapt self-speculative decoding (SSD) for structured language models and introduce confidence-guided decoding (CGD) with an improved scoring mechanism for token reliability. Furthermore, we design a parameter-efficient mechanism that reduces the parameter overhead of MTP. Extensive experiments on the ASE and Structured3D benchmarks demonstrate that Fast SceneScript can generate up to 9 tokens per decoder inference step without compromising accuracy, while adding only $\\sim7.5\\%$ additional parameters.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05597v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.2524, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for

{"title": "Momentum-constrained Hybrid Heuristic Trajectory Optimization Framework with Residual-enhanced DRL for Visually Impaired Scenarios", "author": "Yuting Zeng and Zhiwen Zheng and You Zhou and JiaLing Xiao and Yongbin Yu and Manping Fan and Bo Gong and Liyong Ren", "abstract": "This paper proposes a momentum-constrained hybrid heuristic trajectory optimization framework (MHHTOF) tailored for assistive navigation in visually impaired scenarios, integrating trajectory sampling generation, optimization and evaluation with residual-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive planning tasks.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15582v2",

{"title": "Correspondence-Oriented Imitation Learning: Flexible Visuomotor Control with 3D Conditioning", "author": "Yunhao Cao and Zubin Bhaumik and Jessie Jia and Xingyi He and Kuan Fang", "abstract": "We introduce Correspondence-Oriented Imitation Learning (COIL), a conditional policy learning framework for visuomotor control with a flexible task representation in 3D. At the core of our approach, each task is defined by the intended motion of keypoints selected on objects in the scene. Instead of assuming a fixed number of keypoints or uniformly spaced time intervals, COIL supports task specifications with variable spatial and temporal granularity, adapting to different user intents and task requirements. To robustly ground this correspondence-oriented task representation into actions, we design a conditional policy with a spatio-temporal attention mechanism that effectively fuses information across multiple input modalities. The policy is trained via a scalable self-supervised pipeline using demonstrations collected in simulation, with correspondence labels automatically generated in hindsight. COIL generalizes across tasks, objects, and motion patterns, achieving superior performance compared to prior methods on real-world manipulation tasks under both sparse and dense specifications.",

Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures, such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers emerge as consistent within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together, our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism that explains how external cues enhance multimodal binding and offer both interpretability and practical improvements.",

{"title": "Impugan: Learning Conditional Generative Models for Robust Data Imputation", "author": "Zalish Mahmud and Anantaa Kotal and Aritran Piplai", "abstract": "Incomplete data are common in real-world applications. Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

{"title": "Language-Instructed Reasoning for Group Activity Detection via Multimodal Large Language Model", "author": "Jihua Peng and Qianxiong Xu and Yichen Liu and Chenxi Liu and Cheng Long and Rui Zhao and Ziyue Li", "abstract": "Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g., transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP> tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP> tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively. Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the <ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then, we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in GAD taks.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16054v2", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy":

{"title": "Sparse but Wrong: Incorrect L0 Leads to Incorrect Features in Sparse Autoencoders", "author": "David Chanin and Adri\u00e0 Garriga-Alonso", "abstract": "Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to interpretable concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many SAE features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity-reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value aside from its effect on reconstruction. In this work we study the effect of L0 on SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set correctly, the SAE fails to disentangle the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we present a proxy metric that can help guide the search for the correct L0 for an SAE on a given training distribution. We show that our method finds the correct L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLM SAEs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that L0 must be set correctly to train SAEs with correct features.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16560v3", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.2049, "topK": [{"title": "IAE:

Autonomous vehicles and robots cannot tolerate the geometric errors that sparse reconstruction introduces. We propose curvature regularization through a discrete Laplacian operator, achieving 18.1% better reconstruction accuracy than standard variational autoencoders. Our contribution challenges an implicit assumption in geometric deep learning: that combining multiple geometric constraints improves performance. A single well-designed regularization term not only matches but exceeds the effectiveness of complex multi-term formulations. The discrete Laplacian offers stable gradients and noise suppression with just 15% training overhead and zero inference cost.

{"title": "PRiSM: An Agentic Multimodal Benchmark for Scientific Reasoning via Python-Grounded Evaluation", "author": "Shima Imani and Seungwhan Moon and Adel Ahmadyan and Lu Zhang and Kirmani Ahmed and Babak Damavandi", "abstract": "Evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in scientific domains like mathematics and physics poses unique challenges that go far beyond predicting final answers. These domains demand conceptual understanding, symbolic reasoning, and adherence to formal laws, requirements that most existing benchmarks fail to address. In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution. Through comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, we highlight their limitations and showcase how PRiSM enables deeper insights into their scientific reasoning capabilities.", "link":

{"title": "UG-FedDA: Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation for Multi-Center Alzheimer's Disease Detection", "author": "Fubao Zhu and Zhanyuan Jia and Zhiguo Wang and Huan Huang and Danyang Sun and Chuang Han and Yanting Li and Jiaofen Nan and Chen Zhao and Weihua Zhou", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, and early diagnosis is critical for timely intervention. However, most existing classification frameworks face challenges in multicenter studies, as they often neglect inter-site heterogeneity and lack mechanisms to quantify uncertainty, which limits their robustness and clinical applicability. To address these issues, we proposed Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation (UG-FedDA), a novel multicenter AD classification framework that integrates uncertainty quantification (UQ) with federated domain adaptation to handle cross-site structure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) heterogeneity under privacy constraints. Our approach extracts multi-template region-of-interest (RoI) features using a self-attention transformer, capturing both regional representations and their interactions. UQ is integrated to guide feature alignment, mitigating source-target distribution shifts by down-weighting uncertain samples. Experiments are conducted on three public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). UG-FedDA achieved consistent cross-domain improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the ROC curve across three classification tasks: AD vs. normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI. For NC vs. AD, UG-FedDA achieves accuracies of 90.54%, 89.04%, and 77.78% on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS datasets, respectively. For MCI vs. AD, accuracies are 80.20% (ADNI), 71.91% (AIBL), and 79.73% (OASIS). For NC vs. MCI, results are 76.87% (ADNI), 73.91% (AIBL), and 83.73% (OASIS). These results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only adapts efficiently across multiple sites but also preserves strict privacy.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05814v1", "date":

{"title": "BalLOT: Balanced $k$-means clustering with optimal transport", "author": "Wenyan Luo and Dustin G. Mixon", "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problem of balanced $k$-means clustering. In particular, we introduce an optimal transport approach to alternating minimization called BalLOT, and we show that it delivers a fast and effective solution to this problem. We establish this with a variety of numerical experiments before proving several theoretical guarantees. First, we prove that for generic data, BalLOT produces integral couplings at each step. Next, we perform a landscape analysis to provide theoretical guarantees for both exact and partial recoveries of planted clusters under the stochastic ball model. Finally, we propose initialization schemes that achieve one-step recovery of planted clusters.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05926v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.1591, "topK": [{"title": "Breadcrumbs: Adversarial class-balanced sampling for long-tailed recognition", "link": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20053-3_37", "similarity": 0.4496}, {"title": "uPLAM: Robust Panoptic Localization and Mapping Leveraging Perception\n  Uncertainties", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05840v1", "similarity": 0.4371}, {"title": "GST: Precise 3D Human Body from a Single Image with Gaussian Splatting\n  Transformers", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04196v1", "similarity": 0.4087}], "mailto": "mailto:haoxiang.li.2024@gmail.com?subject=%5BarXrec%5D%20BalLOT%3A%20Balanced%20%24k%24-means%20clustering%20with%20optimal%20transport&body=Title%3A%20BalLOT%3A%20Balanced%20%24k%24-means%20clustering%20with%20optimal%20transport%0AAuthor%3A%20Wenyan%20Luo%20and%20Dustin%20G.%20Mixon%0AAbstract%3A%20We%20consider%20the%20fundamental%20problem%20of%20balanced%20%24k%24-means%20clustering.%20In%20particular%2C%20we%20introduce%20an%20optimal%20transport%20approach%20to%20alternating%20minimization%20called%20BalLOT%2C%20and%20we%20show%20that%20it%20delivers%20a%20fast%20and%20effective%20solution%20to%20this%20problem.%20We%20establish%20this%20with%20a%20variety%20of%20numerical%20experiments%20before%20proving%20several%20theoretical%20guarantees.%20First%2C%20we%20prove%20that%20for%20generic%20data%2C%20BalLOT%20produces%20integral%20couplings%20at%20each%20step.%20Next%2C%20we%20perform%20a%20landscape%20analysis%20to%20provide%20theoretical%20guarantees%20for%20both%20exact%20and%20partial%20recoveries%20of%20planted%20clusters%20under%20the%20stochastic%20ball%20model.%20Finally%2C%20we%20propose%20initialization%20schemes%20that%20achieve%20one-step%20recovery%20of%20planted%20clusters.%0ALink%3A%20http%3A//arxiv.org/abs/2512.05926v1%0AForm%3A%20https%3A//docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSfFqShId9ssA7GWYmvv7m_7qsIao4K__1rDj9BurNNxUPYQ/viewform%3Fentry.1380929848%3DBalLOT%253A%2520Balanced%2520%2524k%2524-means%2520clustering%2520with%2520optimal%2520transport%26entry.906535625%3DWenyan%2520Luo%2520and%2520Dustin%2520G.%2520Mixon%26entry.1292438233%3DWe%2520consider%2520the%2520fundamental%2520problem%2520of%2520balanced%2520%2524k%2524-means%2520clustering.%2520In%2520particular%252C%2520we%2520introduce%2520an%2520optimal%2520transport%2520approach%2520to%2520alternating%2520minimization%2520called%2520BalLOT%252C%2520and%2520we%2520show%2520that%2520it%2520delivers%2520a%2520fast%2520and%2520effective%2520solution%2520to%2520this%2520problem.%2520We%2520establish%2520this%2520with%2520a%2520variety%2520of%2520numerical%2520experiments%2520before%2520proving%2520several%2520theoretical%2520guarantees.%2520First%252C%2520we%2520prove%2520that%2520for%2520generic%2520data%252C%2520BalLOT%2520produces%2520integral%2520couplings%2520at%2520each%2520step.%2520Next%252C%2520we%2520perform%2520a%2520landscape%2520analysis%2520to%2520provide%2520theoretical%2520guarantees%2520for%2520both%2520exact%2520and%2520partial%2520recoveries%2520of%2520planted%2520clusters%2520under%2520the%2520stochastic%2520ball%2520model.%2520Finally%252C%2520we%2520propose%2520initialization%2520schemes%2520that%2520achieve%2520one-step%2520recovery%2520of%2520planted%2520clusters.%26entry.1838667208%3Dhttp%253A//arxiv.org/abs/2512.05926v1%26entry.124074799%3DRead", "form": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSfFqShId9ssA7GWYmvv7m_7qsIao4K__1rDj9BurNNxUPYQ/viewform?entry.1380929848=BalLOT%3A%20Balanced%20%24k%24-means%20clustering%20with%20optimal%20transport&entry.906535625=Wenyan%20Luo%20and%20Dustin%20G.%20Mixon&entry.1292438233=We%20consider%20the%20fundamental%20problem%20of%20balanced%20%24k%24-means%20clustering.%20In%20particular%2C%20we%20introduce%20an%20optimal%20transport%20approach%20to%20alternating%20minimization%20called%20BalLOT%2C%20and%20we%20show%20that%20it%20delivers%20a%20fast%20and%20effective%20solution%20to%20this%20problem.%20We%20establish%20this%20with%20a%20variety%20of%20numerical%20experiments%20before%20proving%20several%20theoretical%20guarantees.%20First%2C%20we%20prove%20that%20for%20generic%20data%2C%20BalLOT%20produces%20integral%20couplings%20at%20each%20step.%20Next%2C%20we%20perform%20a%20landscape%20analysis%20to%20provide%20theoretical%20guarantees%20for%20both%20exact%20and%20partial%20recoveries%20of%20planted%20clusters%20under%20the%20stochastic%20ball%20model.%20Finally%2C%20we%20propose%20initialization%20schemes%20that%20achieve%20one-step%20recovery%20of%20planted%20clusters.&entry.1838667208=http%3A//arxiv.org/abs/2512.05926v1&entry.124074799=Read"},
{"title": "NEAT: Neighborhood-Guided, Efficient, Autoregressive Set Transformer for 3D Molecular Generation", "author": "Daniel Rose and Roxane Axel Jacob and Johannes Kirchmair and Thierry Langer", "abstract": "Autoregressive models are a promising alternative to diffusion-based models for 3D molecular structure generation. However, a key limitation is the assumption of a token order: while text has a natural sequential order, the next token prediction given a molecular graph prefix should be invariant to atom permutations. Previous works sidestepped this mismatch by using canonical orders or focus atoms. We argue that this is unnecessary. We introduce NEAT, a Neighborhood-guided, Efficient, Autoregressive, Set Transformer that treats molecular graphs as sets of atoms and learns the order-agnostic distribution over admissible tokens at the graph boundary with an autoregressive flow model. NEAT approaches state-of-the-art performance in 3D molecular generation with high computational efficiency and atom-level permutation invariance, establishing a practical foundation for scalable molecular design.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05844v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.1569, "topK": [{"title": "Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image

However, its integration with robotic grasping systems has so far been explored due to the deployment complexities and prohibitive costs. Within this paper, we introduce a novel hyperspectral imaging-guided robotic grasping system. The system consists of PRISM (Polyhedral Reflective Imaging Scanning Mechanism) and the SpectralGrasp framework. PRISM is designed to enable high-precision, distortion-free hyperspectral imaging while simplifying system integration and costs. SpectralGrasp generates robotic grasping strategies by effectively leveraging both the spatial and spectral information from hyperspectral images. The proposed system demonstrates substantial improvements in both textile recognition compared to human performance and sorting success rate compared to RGB-based methods. Additionally, a series of comparative experiments further validates the effectiveness of our system. The study highlights the potential benefits of integrating hyperspectral imaging with robotic grasping systems, showcasing enhanced recognition and grasping capabilities in complex and dynamic environments.

{"title": "QoSDiff: An Implicit Topological Embedding Learning Framework Leveraging Denoising Diffusion and Adversarial Attention for Robust QoS Prediction", "author": "Guanchen Du and Jianlong Xu and Wei Wei", "abstract": "Accurate Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is fundamental to service computing, providing essential data-driven guidance for service selection and ensuring superior user experiences. However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. Such reliance not only leads to the intractability of explicit graph construction in large-scale scenarios but also limits the modeling of implicit topological relationships and exacerbates susceptibility to environmental noise and outliers. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that QoSDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the results highlight the framework's superior cross-dataset generalization capability and exceptional robustness against observational noise.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04596v2",

{"title": "Distilling Expert Surgical Knowledge: How to train local surgical VLMs for anatomy explanation in Complete Mesocolic Excision", "author": "Lennart Maack and Julia-Kristin Gra\u00df and Lisa-Marie Toscha and Nathaniel Melling and Alexander Schlaefer", "abstract": "Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated high potential in computer-aided diagnosis and decision-support. However, current VLMs show deficits in domain specific surgical scene understanding, such as identifying and explaining anatomical landmarks during Complete Mesocolic Excision. Additionally, there is a need for locally deployable models to avoid patient data leakage to large VLMs, hosted outside the clinic. We propose a privacy-preserving framework to distill knowledge from large, general-purpose LLMs into an efficient, local VLM. We generate an expert-supervised dataset by prompting a teacher LLM without sensitive images, using only textual context and binary segmentation masks for spatial information. This dataset is used for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) of the locally deployable VLM. Our evaluation confirms that finetuning VLMs with our generated datasets increases surgical domain knowledge compared to its base VLM by a large margin. Overall, this work validates a data-efficient and privacy-conforming way to train a surgical domain optimized, locally deployable VLM for surgical scene understanding.", "link":

{"title": "AQUA-Net: Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network for Underwater Image Enhancement", "author": "Munsif Ali and Najmul Hassan and Lucia Ventura and Davide Di Bari and Simonepietro Canese", "abstract": "Underwater images often suffer from severe color distortion, low contrast, and a hazy appearance due to wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering. Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications.", "link":

{"title": "Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks", "author": "Nino Antulov-Fantulin", "abstract": "In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, network locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate gradient-based counterfactual analysis for policy interventions.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.1297, "topK": [{"title": "Boosted dynamic neural networks",

Unlike conventional approaches, it generates feasible, safety-aligned trajectories based on textual instructions, enabling adaptable and context-aware driving behavior. It combines an encoder-decoder multimodal trajectory prediction model with a pre-trained LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, projecting scene features into the LLM input space and mapping special tokens to a trajectory decoder for text-based interaction and interpretable driving. To support this framework, we introduce two datasets: 1) InstructWaymo, an extension of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset with direction-based motion instructions, and 2) Open-Vocabulary InstructNuPlan, which features safety-aligned instruction-caption pairs and corresponding safe trajectory scenarios. Our experiments validate that instruction conditioning enables trajectory generation that follows the intended condition. iMotion-LLM demonstrates strong contextual comprehension, achieving 84% average accuracy in direction feasibility detection and 96% average accuracy in safety evaluation of open-vocabulary instructions. This work lays the foundation for text-guided motion generation in autonomous driving, supporting simulated data generation, model interpretability, and robust safety alignment testing for trajectory generation models.

{"title": "Bootstrapping Fuzzers for Compilers of Low-Resource Language Dialects Using Language Models", "author": "Sairam Vaidya and Marcel B\u00f6hme and Loris D'Antoni", "abstract": "Modern extensible compiler frameworks-such as MLIR-enable rapid creation of domain-specific language dialects. This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem. Germinator discovers 88 previously unknown bugs (40 confirmed), including 23 in dialects with no prior automated test generators, demonstrating effective and controllable testing of low-resource dialects at scale.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05887v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.1091, "topK": [{"title": "UGG: Unified Generative Grasping", "link":

{"title": "Underwater Image Reconstruction Using a Swin Transformer-Based Generator and PatchGAN Discriminator", "author": "Md. Mahbub Hasan Akash and Aria Tasnim Mridula and Sheekar Banerjee and Ishtiak Al Mamoon", "abstract": "Underwater imaging is essential for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, water causes severe image degradation through wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and haze effects. Traditional reconstruction methods and convolutional neural network-based approaches often fail to adequately address these challenges due to limited receptive fields and inability to model global dependencies. This paper presented a novel deep learning framework that integrated a Swin Transformer architecture within a generative adversarial network (GAN) for underwater image reconstruction. Our generator employed a U-Net structure with Swin Transformer blocks to capture both local features and long-range dependencies crucial for color correction across entire images. A PatchGAN discriminator provided adversarial training to ensure high-frequency detail preservation. We trained and evaluated our model on the EUVP dataset, which contains paired underwater images of varying quality. Quantitative results demonstrate stateof-the-art performance with PSNR of 24.76 dB and SSIM of 0.89, representing significant improvements over existing methods. Visual results showed effective color balance restoration, contrast improvement, and haze reduction. An ablation study confirms the superiority of our Swin Transformer designed over convolutional alternatives. The proposed method offers robust underwater image reconstruction suitable for various marine applications.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05866v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.1079,

Zavlanos and Karl H. Johansson", "abstract": "We study a class of distributionally robust games where agents are allowed to heterogeneously choose their risk aversion with respect to distributional shifts of the uncertainty. In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping. We then design an approximate Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and prove convergence of the average regret to a quantity that diminishes with the number of iterations, thus learning the desired equilibrium up to an a priori specified accuracy. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14048v2", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.1072, "topK": [{"title": "uPLAM: Robust Panoptic

{"title": "VRSA: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models through Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack", "author": "Shiji Zhao and Shukun Xiong and Yao Huang and Yan Jin and Zhenyu Wu and Jiyang Guan and Ranjie Duan and Jialing Tao and Hui Xue and Xingxing Wei", "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely used in various fields due to their powerful cross-modal comprehension and generation capabilities. However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05853v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.096, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for

{"title": "Exploring Ordinal Bias in Action Recognition for Instructional Videos", "author": "Joochan Kim and Minjoon Jung and Byoung-Tak Zhang", "abstract": "Action recognition models have achieved promising results in understanding instructional videos. However, they often rely on dominant, dataset-specific action sequences rather than true video comprehension, a problem that we define as ordinal bias. To address this issue, we propose two effective video manipulation methods: Action Masking, which masks frames of frequently co-occurring actions, and Sequence Shuffling, which randomizes the order of action segments. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that current models exhibit significant performance drops when confronted with nonstandard action sequences, underscoring their vulnerability to ordinal bias. Our findings emphasize the importance of rethinking evaluation strategies and developing models capable of generalizing beyond fixed action patterns in diverse instructional videos.", "link":

{"title": "SPARTAN: A Sparse Transformer World Model Attending to What Matters", "author": "Anson Lei and Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf and Ingmar Posner", "abstract": "Capturing the interactions between entities in a structured way plays a central role in world models that flexibly adapt to changes in the environment. Recent works motivate the benefits of models that explicitly represent the structure of interactions and formulate the problem as discovering local causal structures. In this work, we demonstrate that reliably capturing these relationships in complex settings remains challenging. To remedy this shortcoming, we postulate that sparsity is a critical ingredient for the discovery of such local structures. To this end, we present the SPARse TrANsformer World model (SPARTAN), a Transformer-based world model that learns context-dependent interaction structures between entities in a scene. By applying sparsity regularisation on the attention patterns between object-factored tokens, SPARTAN learns sparse, context-dependent interaction graphs that accurately predict future object states. We further extend our model to adapt to sparse interventions with unknown targets in the dynamics of the environment. This results in a highly interpretable world model that can efficiently adapt to changes. Empirically, we evaluate SPARTAN against the current state-of-the-art in object-centric world models in observation-based environments and demonstrate that our model can learn local causal graphs that accurately reflect the underlying interactions between objects, achieving significantly improved few-shot adaptation to dynamics changes, as well as robustness against distractors.", "link":

{"title": "CookAnything: A Framework for Flexible and Consistent Multi-Step Recipe Image Generation", "author": "Ruoxuan Zhang and Bin Wen and Hongxia Xie and Yi Yao and Songhan Zuo and Jian-Yu Jiang-Lin and Hong-Han Shuai and Wen-Huang Cheng", "abstract": "Cooking is a sequential and visually grounded activity, where each step such as chopping, mixing, or frying carries both procedural logic and visual semantics. While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration. Additionally, current recipe illustration methods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results on recipe illustration benchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings. The proposed framework supports scalable, high-quality visual synthesis of complex multi-step instructions and holds significant potential for broad applications in instructional media, and procedural

{"title": "On Dynamic Programming Theory for Leader-Follower Stochastic Games", "author": "Jilles Steeve Dibangoye and Thibaut Le Marre and Ocan Sankur and Fran\u00e7ois Schwarzentruber", "abstract": "Leader-follower general-sum stochastic games (LF-GSSGs) model sequential decision-making under asymmetric commitment, where a leader commits to a policy and a follower best responds, yielding a strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) with leader-favourable tie-breaking. This paper introduces a dynamic programming (DP) framework that applies Bellman recursion over credible sets-state abstractions formally representing all rational follower best responses under partial leader commitments-to compute SSEs. We first prove that any LF-GSSG admits a lossless reduction to a Markov decision process (MDP) over credible sets. We further establish that synthesising an optimal memoryless deterministic leader policy is NP-hard, motivating the development of \u03b5-optimal DP algorithms with provable guarantees on leader exploitability. Experiments on standard mixed-motive benchmarks-including security games, resource allocation, and adversarial planning-demonstrate empirical gains in leader value and runtime scalability over state-of-the-art methods.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05667v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.0567, "topK": [{"title": "Safe and efficient training of a control agent", "link":

{"title": "A Control Perspective on Training PINNs", "author": "Matthieu Barreau and Haoming Shen", "abstract": "We investigate the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) from a control-theoretic perspective. Using gradient descent with resampling, we interpret the training dynamics as asymptotically equivalent to a stochastic control-affine system, where sampling effects act as process disturbances and measurement noise. Within this framework, we introduce two controllers for dynamically adapting the physics weight: an integral controller and a leaky integral controller. We theoretically analyze their asymptotic properties under the accuracy-robustness trade-off, and we evaluate them on a toy example. Numerical evidence suggests that the integral controller achieves accurate and robust convergence when the physical model is correct, whereas the leaky integrator provides improved performance in the presence of model mismatch. This work represents a first step toward convergence guarantees and principled training algorithms tailored to the distinct characteristics of PINN tasks.", "link":

{"title": "DistillFSS: Synthesizing Few-Shot Knowledge into a Lightweight Segmentation Model", "author": "Pasquale De Marinis and Pieter M. Blok and Uzay Kaymak and Rogier Brussee and Gennaro Vessio and Giovanna Castellano", "abstract": "Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (CD-FSS) seeks to segment unknown classes in unseen domains using only a few annotated examples. This setting is inherently challenging: source and target domains exhibit substantial distribution shifts, label spaces are disjoint, and support images are scarce--making standard episodic methods unreliable and computationally demanding at test time. To address these constraints, we propose DistillFSS, a framework that embeds support-set knowledge directly into a model's parameters through a teacher--student distillation process. By internalizing few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within the student network, DistillFSS eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast, lightweight inference, while allowing efficient extension to novel classes in unseen domains through rapid teacher-driven specialization. Combined with fine-tuning, the approach scales efficiently to large support sets and significantly reduces computational overhead. To evaluate the framework under realistic conditions, we introduce a new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, with disjoint label spaces and variable support sizes. Experiments show that DistillFSS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, while offering substantial efficiency gains.

{"title": "DAE-HardNet: A Physics Constrained Neural Network Enforcing Differential-Algebraic Hard Constraints", "author": "Rahul Golder and Bimol Nath Roy and M. M. Faruque Hasan", "abstract": "Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not always satisfy physics based constraints, especially when the constraints include differential operators. Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference.

{"title": "Synset Signset Germany: a Synthetic Dataset for German Traffic Sign Recognition", "author": "Anne Sielemann and Lena Loercher and Max-Lion Schumacher and Stefan Wolf and Masoud Roschani and Jens Ziehn", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a synthesis pipeline and dataset for training / testing data in the task of traffic sign recognition that combines the advantages of data-driven and analytical modeling: GAN-based texture generation enables data-driven dirt and wear artifacts, rendering unique and realistic traffic sign surfaces, while the analytical scene modulation achieves physically correct lighting and allows detailed parameterization. In particular, the latter opens up applications in the context of explainable AI (XAI) and robustness tests due to the possibility of evaluating the sensitivity to parameter changes, which we demonstrate with experiments. Our resulting synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset Synset Signset Germany contains a total of 105500 images of 211 different German traffic sign classes, including newly published (2020) and thus comparatively rare traffic signs. In addition to a mask and a segmentation image, we also provide extensive metadata including the stochastically selected environment and imaging effect parameters for each image. We evaluate the degree of realism of Synset Signset Germany on the real-world German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and in comparison to CATERED, a state-of-the-art synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05936v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 2.0465, "topK": [{"title": "GeneVA: A Dataset of Human Annotations for Generative Text to Video\n

{"title": "KQ-SVD: Compressing the KV Cache with Provable Guarantees on Attention Fidelity", "author": "Damien Lesens and Beheshteh T. Rakhshan and Guillaume Rabusseau", "abstract": "The Key-Value (KV) cache is central to the efficiency of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), storing previously computed vectors to accelerate inference. Yet, as sequence length and batch size grow, the cache becomes a major memory bottleneck. Prior compression methods typically apply low-rank decomposition to keys alone or attempt to jointly embed queries and keys, but both approaches neglect that attention fundamentally depends on their inner products. In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution. By targeting the true source of redundancy, KQ-SVD preserves attention outputs with higher fidelity under compression. Extensive evaluations on LLaMA and Mistral models demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers superior projection quality.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05916v1", "date": "2025-12-05",

{"title": "Hyperspectral Unmixing with 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding and Projected Simplex Volume Maximization", "author": "Gargi Panda and Soumitra Kundu and Saumik Bhattacharya and Aurobinda Routray", "abstract": "Hyperspectral unmixing (HSU) aims to separate each pixel into its constituent endmembers and estimate their corresponding abundance fractions. This work presents an algorithm-unrolling-based network for the HSU task, named the 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding Network (3D-CSCNet), built upon a 3D CSC model. Unlike existing unrolling-based networks, our 3D-CSCNet is designed within the powerful autoencoder (AE) framework. Specifically, to solve the 3D CSC problem, we propose a 3D CSC block (3D-CSCB) derived through deep algorithm unrolling. Given a hyperspectral image (HSI), 3D-CSCNet employs the 3D-CSCB to estimate the abundance matrix. The use of 3D CSC enables joint learning of spectral and spatial relationships in the 3D HSI data cube. The estimated abundance matrix is then passed to the AE decoder to reconstruct the HSI, and the decoder weights are extracted as the endmember matrix. Additionally, we propose a projected simplex volume maximization (PSVM) algorithm for endmember estimation, and the resulting endmembers are used to initialize the decoder weights of 3D-CSCNet. Extensive experiments on three real datasets and one simulated dataset with three different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels demonstrate that our 3D-CSCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

{"title": "Edit-aware RAW Reconstruction", "author": "Abhijith Punnappurath and Luxi Zhao and Ke Zhao and Hue Nguyen and Radek Grzeszczuk and Michael S. Brown", "abstract": "Users frequently edit camera images post-capture to achieve their preferred photofinishing style. While editing in the RAW domain provides greater accuracy and flexibility, most edits are performed on the camera's display-referred output (e.g., 8-bit sRGB JPEG) since RAW images are rarely stored. Existing RAW reconstruction methods can recover RAW data from sRGB images, but these approaches are typically optimized for pixel-wise RAW reconstruction fidelity and tend to degrade under diverse rendering styles and editing operations. We introduce a plug-and-play, edit-aware loss function that can be integrated into any existing RAW reconstruction framework to make the recovered RAWs more robust to different rendering styles and edits. Our loss formulation incorporates a modular, differentiable image signal processor (ISP) that simulates realistic photofinishing pipelines with tunable parameters. During training, parameters for each ISP module are randomly sampled from carefully designed distributions that model practical variations in real camera processing. The loss is then computed in sRGB space between ground-truth and reconstructed RAWs rendered through this differentiable ISP. Incorporating our loss improves sRGB reconstruction quality by up to 1.5-2 dB PSNR across various editing conditions. Moreover, when applied to metadata-assisted RAW reconstruction methods, our approach enables fine-tuning for target edits, yielding further gains. Since photographic editing is the primary motivation for RAW reconstruction in consumer imaging, our simple yet effective loss function provides a general mechanism for enhancing edit fidelity and

{"title": "Whatever Remains Must Be True: Filtering Drives Reasoning in LLMs, Shaping Diversity", "author": "Germ\u00e1n Kruszewski and Pierre Erbacher and Jos Rozen and Marc Dymetman", "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the de facto standard for tuning LLMs to solve tasks involving reasoning. However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $\u03b1$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis.", "link":

{"title": "Measuring the Effect of Background on Classification and Feature Importance in Deep Learning for AV Perception", "author": "Anne Sielemann and Valentin Barner and Stefan Wolf and Masoud Roschani and Jens Ziehn and Juergen Beyerer", "abstract": "Common approaches to explainable AI (XAI) for deep learning focus on analyzing the importance of input features on the classification task in a given model: saliency methods like SHAP and GradCAM are used to measure the impact of spatial regions of the input image on the classification result. Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance. [...] Results include a quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support the classification task based on changes in the training domain [...].\n  Download:

{"title": "Adapting Noise to Data: Generative Flows from 1D Processes", "author": "Jannis Chemseddine and Gregor Kornhardt and Richard Duong and Gabriele Steidl", "abstract": "We introduce a general framework for constructing generative models using one-dimensional noising processes. Beyond diffusion processes, we outline examples that demonstrate the flexibility of our approach. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework in which the 1D processes themselves are learnable, achieved by parameterizing the noise distribution through quantile functions that adapt to the data. Our construction integrates seamlessly with standard objectives, including Flow Matching and consistency models. Learning quantile-based noise naturally captures heavy tails and compact supports when present. Numerical experiments highlight both the flexibility and the effectiveness of our method.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12636v3", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 1.6055, "topK": [{"title": "Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03206v1", "similarity": 0.6131}, {"title": "Tuning-Free Noise Rectification for High Fidelity Image-to-Video\n  Generation", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02827v1", "similarity": 0.5175}, {"title": "Thinking Outside the BBox: Unconstrained Generative Object Compositing", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04559v2", "similarity": 0.5015}], "mailto": "mailto:haoxiang.li.2024@gmail.com?subject=%5BarXrec%5D%20Adapting%20Noise%20to%20Data%3A%20Generative%20Flows%20from%201D%20Processes&body=Title%3A%20Adapting%20Noise%20to%20Data%3A%20Generative%20Flows%20from%201D%20Processes%0AAuthor%3A%20Jannis%20Chemseddine%20and%20Gregor%20Kornhardt%20and%20Richard%20Duong%20and%20Gabriele%20Steidl%0AAbstract%3A%20We%20introduce%20a%20general%20framework%20for%20constructing%20generative%20models%20using%20one-dimensional%20noising%20processes.%20Beyond%20diffusion%20processes%2C%20we%20outline%20examples%20that%20demonstrate%20the%20flexibility%20of%20our%20approach.%20Motivated%20by%20this%2C%20we%20propose%20a%20novel%20framework%20in%20which%20the%201D%20processes%20themselves%20are%20learnable%2C%20achieved%20by%20parameterizing%20the%20noise%20distribution%20through%20quantile%20functions%20that%20adapt%20to%20the%20data.%20Our%20construction%20integrates%20seamlessly%20with%20standard%20objectives%2C%20including%20Flow%20Matching%20and%20consistency%20models.%20Learning%20quantile-based%20noise%20naturally%20captures%20heavy%20tails%20and%20compact%20supports%20when%20present.%20Numerical%20experiments%20highlight%20both%20the%20flexibility%20and%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20our%20method.%0ALink%3A%20http%3A//arxiv.org/abs/2510.12636v3%0AForm%3A%20https%3A//docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSfFqShId9ssA7GWYmvv7m_7qsIao4K__1rDj9BurNNxUPYQ/viewform%3Fentry.1380929848%3DAdapting%2520Noise%2520to%2520Data%253A%2520Generative%2520Flows%2520from%25201D%2520Processes%26entry.906535625%3DJannis%2520Chemseddine%2520and%2520Gregor%2520Kornhardt%2520and%2520Richard%2520Duong%2520and%2520Gabriele%2520Steidl%26entry.1292438233%3DWe%2520introduce%2520a%2520general%2520framework%2520for%2520constructing%2520generative%2520models%2520using%2520one-dimensional%2520noising%2520processes.%2520Beyond%2520diffusion%2520processes%252C%2520we%2520outline%2520examples%2520that%2520demonstrate%2520the%2520flexibility%2520of%2520our%2520approach.%2520Motivated%2520by%2520this%252C%2520we%2520propose%2520a%2520novel%2520framework%2520in%2520which%2520the%25201D%2520processes%2520themselves%2520are%2520learnable%252C%2520achieved%2520by%2520parameterizing%2520the%2520noise%2520distribution%2520through%2520quantile%2520functions%2520that%2520adapt%2520to%2520the%2520data.%2520Our%2520construction%2520integrates%2520seamlessly%2520with%2520standard%2520objectives%252C%2520including%2520Flow%2520Matching%2520and%2520consistency%2520models.%2520Learning%2520quantile-based%2520noise%2520naturally%2520captures%2520heavy%2520tails%2520and%2520compact%2520supports%2520when%2520present.%2520Numerical%2520experiments%2520highlight%2520both%2520the%2520flexibility%2520and%2520the%2520effectiveness%2520of%2520our%2520method.%26entry.1838667208%3Dhttp%253A//arxiv.org/abs/2510.12636v3%26entry.124074799%3DRead", "form": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSfFqShId9ssA7GWYmvv7m_7qsIao4K__1rDj9BurNNxUPYQ/viewform?entry.1380929848=Adapting%20Noise%20to%20Data%3A%20Generative%20Flows%20from%201D%20Processes&entry.906535625=Jannis%20Chemseddine%20and%20Gregor%20Kornhardt%20and%20Richard%20Duong%20and%20Gabriele%20Steidl&entry.1292438233=We%20introduce%20a%20general%20framework%20for%20constructing%20generative%20models%20using%20one-dimensional%20noising%20processes.%20Beyond%20diffusion%20processes%2C%20we%20outline%20examples%20that%20demonstrate%20the%20flexibility%20of%20our%20approach.%20Motivated%20by%20this%2C%20we%20propose%20a%20novel%20framework%20in%20which%20the%201D%20processes%20themselves%20are%20learnable%2C%20achieved%20by%20parameterizing%20the%20noise%20distribution%20through%20quantile%20functions%20that%20adapt%20to%20the%20data.%20Our%20construction%20integrates%20seamlessly%20with%20standard%20objectives%2C%20including%20Flow%20Matching%20and%20consistency%20models.%20Learning%20quantile-based%20noise%20naturally%20captures%20heavy%20tails%20and%20compact%20supports%20when%20present.%20Numerical%20experiments%20highlight%20both%20the%20flexibility%20and%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20our%20method.&entry.1838667208=http%3A//arxiv.org/abs/2510.12636v3&entry.124074799=Read"},
{"title": "NeuroMemFPP: A recurrent neural approach for memory-aware parameter estimation in fractional Poisson process", "author": "Neha Gupta and Aditya Maheshwari", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based framework for estimating the parameters of the fractional Poisson process (FPP), which models event arrivals with memory and long-range dependence. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network estimates the key parameters $\u03bc>0$ and $\u03b2\\in(0,1)$ from sequences of inter-arrival times, effectively modeling their temporal dependencies. Our experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed approach reduces the mean squared error (MSE) by about 55.3\\% compared to the traditional method of moments (MOM) and performs reliably across different training conditions. We tested the method on two real-world high-frequency datasets: emergency call records from Montgomery County, PA, and AAPL stock trading data. The results show that the LSTM can effectively track daily patterns and parameter changes, indicating its effectiveness on real-world data with complex time dependencies.", "link":

{"title": "BERTO: an Adaptive BERT-based Network Time Series Predictor with Operator Preferences in Natural Language", "author": "Nitin Priyadarshini Shankar and Vaibhav Singh and Sheetal Kalyani and Christian Maciocco", "abstract": "We introduce BERTO, a BERT-based framework for traffic prediction and energy optimization in cellular networks. Built on transformer architectures, BERTO delivers high prediction accuracy, while its Balancing Loss Function and prompt-based customization allow operators to adjust the trade-off between power savings and performance. Natural language prompts guide the model to manage underprediction and overprediction in accordance with the operator's intent. Experiments on real-world datasets show that BERTO improves upon existing models with a $4.13$\\% reduction in MSE while introducing the feature of balancing competing objectives of power saving and performance through simple natural language inputs, operating over a flexible range of $1.4$ kW in power and up to $9\\times$ variation in service quality, making it well suited for intelligent RAN

{"title": "Grounded Multilingual Medical Reasoning for Question Answering with Large Language Models", "author": "Pietro Ferrazzi and Aitor Soroa and Rodrigo Agerri", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have recently demonstrated strong potential in medical Question Answering (QA). Existing approaches are largely English-focused and primarily rely on distillation from general-purpose LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of their medical knowledge. In this work, we present a method to generate multilingual reasoning traces grounded in factual medical knowledge. We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish. We test our pipeline in both in-domain and outof-domain settings across Medical QA benchmarks, and demonstrate that our reasoning traces improve performance both when utilized via in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, yielding state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter LLMs. We believe that these resources can support the development of safer, more transparent clinical decision-support tools in multilingual settings. We release the full suite of resources: reasoning traces, translated QA datasets, Medical-Wikipedia, and fine-tuned models.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05658v1", "date": "2025-12-05",

{"title": "Statistical Guarantees for Approximate Stationary Points of Shallow Neural Networks", "author": "Mahsa Taheri and Fang Xie and Johannes Lederer", "abstract": "Since statistical guarantees for neural networks are usually restricted to global optima of intricate objective functions, it is unclear whether these theories explain the performances of actual outputs of neural network pipelines. The goal of this paper is, therefore, to bring statistical theory closer to practice. We develop statistical guarantees for shallow linear neural networks that coincide up to logarithmic factors with the global optima but apply to stationary points and the points nearby. These results support the common notion that neural networks do not necessarily need to be optimized globally from a mathematical perspective. We then extend our statistical guarantees to shallow ReLU neural networks, assuming the first layer weight matrices are nearly identical for the stationary network and the target. More generally, despite being limited to shallow neural networks for now, our theories make an important step forward in describing the practical properties of neural networks in mathematical terms.",

{"title": "A Residual Variance Matching Recursive Least Squares Filter for Real-time UAV Terrain Following", "author": "Xiaobo Wu and Youmin Zhang", "abstract": "Accurate real-time waypoints estimation for the UAV-based online Terrain Following during wildfire patrol missions is critical to ensuring flight safety and enabling wildfire detection. However, existing real-time filtering algorithms struggle to maintain accurate waypoints under measurement noise in nonlinear and time-varying systems, posing risks of flight instability and missed wildfire detections during UAV-based terrain following. To address this issue, a Residual Variance Matching Recursive Least Squares (RVM-RLS) filter, guided by a Residual Variance Matching Estimation (RVME) criterion, is proposed to adaptively estimate the real-time waypoints of nonlinear, time-varying UAV-based terrain following systems. The proposed method is validated using a UAV-based online terrain following system within a simulated terrain environment. Experimental results show that the RVM-RLS filter improves waypoints estimation accuracy by approximately 88$\\%$ compared with benchmark algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics. These findings demonstrate both the methodological advances in real-time filtering and the practical potential of the RVM-RLS filter for UAV-based online wildfire patrol.", "link":

However, the computational cost of optimizing the acquisition function remains a significant bottleneck, primarily due to the expense of HV improvement calculations. While HV box-decomposition offers an efficient way to cope with the frequent exact improvement calculations, it suffers from super-polynomial memory complexity $O(MN^{\\lfloor \\frac{M + 1}{2} \\rfloor})$ in the worst case as proposed by Lacour et al. (2017). To tackle this problem, Couckuyt et al. (2012) employed an approximation algorithm. However, a rigorous algorithmic description is currently absent from the literature. This paper bridges this gap by providing comprehensive mathematical and algorithmic details of this approximation algorithm.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05825v1", "date": "2025-12-05",

{"title": "Toward Efficient and Robust Behavior Models for Multi-Agent Driving Simulation", "author": "Fabian Konstantinidis and Moritz Sackmann and Ulrich Hofmann and Christoph Stiller", "abstract": "Scalable multi-agent driving simulation requires behavior models that are both realistic and computationally efficient. We address this by optimizing the behavior model that controls individual traffic participants. To improve efficiency, we adopt an instance-centric scene representation, where each traffic participant and map element is modeled in its own local coordinate frame. This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training. Experiments demonstrate that our approach scales efficiently with the number of tokens, significantly reducing training and inference times, while outperforming several agent-centric baselines in terms of positional accuracy and robustness.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05812v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 1.7021, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to Feel It To Believe It:

{"title": "Scenario-aware Uncertainty Quantification for Trajectory Prediction with Statistical Guarantees", "author": "Yiming Shu and Jiahui Xu and Linghuan Kong and Fangni Zhang and Guodong Yin and Chen Sun", "abstract": "Reliable uncertainty quantification in trajectory prediction is crucial for safety-critical autonomous driving systems, yet existing deep learning predictors lack uncertainty-aware frameworks adaptable to heterogeneous real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel scenario-aware uncertainty quantification framework to provide the predicted trajectories with prediction intervals and reliability assessment. To begin with, predicted trajectories from the trained predictor and their ground truth are projected onto the map-derived reference routes within the Frenet coordinate system. We then employ CopulaCPTS as the conformal calibration method to generate temporal prediction intervals for distinct scenarios as the uncertainty measure. Building upon this, within the proposed trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD), mean error and calibrated confidence intervals are synergistically analyzed to establish reliability models for different scenarios. Subsequently, the risk-aware discriminator leverages a joint risk model that integrates longitudinal and lateral prediction intervals within the Frenet coordinate to identify critical points. This enables segmentation of trajectories into reliable and unreliable segments, holding the advantage of informing downstream planning modules with actionable reliability results. We evaluated our framework using the real-world nuPlan dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenario-aware uncertainty quantification and reliability assessment across diverse driving contexts.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05682v1", "date": "2025-12-05", "relevancy": 1.71, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to Feel It To Believe It: Multi-Modal Bayesian Inference for\n

By leveraging the Koopman operator in an autoencoder (AE) framework, the system's state evolution is linearized in the latent space using a dynamic semantic Koopman (DSK) model, capturing the baseline semantic dynamics. Signal temporal logic (STL) is incorporated through a logical semantic Koopman (LSK) model to encode system-specific control rules. These models form the proposed logical Koopman AE framework that reduces communication costs while improving state prediction accuracy and control performance, showing a 91.65% reduction in
