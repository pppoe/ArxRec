{"title": "GaMO: Geometry-aware Multi-view Diffusion Outpainting for Sparse-View 3D Reconstruction", "author": "Yi-Chuan Huang and Hao-Jen Chien and Chin-Yang Lin and Ying-Huan Chen and Yu-Lun Liu", "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

{"title": "Inference-based GAN Video Generation", "author": "Jingbo Yang and Adrian G. Bors", "abstract": "Video generation has seen remarkable progress thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. However, generating long sequences remains a significant challenge. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Models such as GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, typically up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. Classical approaches often result in degraded video quality when attempting to increase the generated video length, especially for significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, where each state represents a short-length VAE-GAN video generator. This setup enables the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, maintaining temporal dependencies and resulting in meaningful long video sequences.", "link":

{"title": "FoundationSLAM: Unleashing the Power of Depth Foundation Models for End-to-End Dense Visual SLAM", "author": "Yuchen Wu and Jiahe Li and Fabio Tosi and Matteo Poggi and Jin Zheng and Xiao Bai", "abstract": "We present FoundationSLAM, a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that addresses the absence of geometric consistency in previous flow-based approaches for accurate and robust tracking and mapping. Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25008v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 3.0152, "topK":

{"title": "PhysTalk: Language-driven Real-time Physics in 3D Gaussian Scenes", "author": "Luca Collorone and Mert Kiray and Indro Spinelli and Fabio Galasso and Benjamin Busam", "abstract": "Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a \"render and wait\" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24986v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 3.0134, "topK": [{"title": "PhysGen: Rigid-Body Physics-Grounded

{"title": "DAVE: A VLM Vision Encoder for Document Understanding and Web Agents", "author": "Brandon Huang and Hang Hua and Zhuoran Yu and Trevor Darrell and Rogerio Feris and Roei Herzig", "abstract": "While Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multi-modal tasks, their choice of vision encoders presents a fundamental weakness: their low-level features lack the robust structural and spatial information essential for document understanding and web agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce DAVE, a vision encoder purpose-built for VLMs and tailored for these tasks. Our training pipeline is designed to leverage abundant unlabeled data to bypass the need for costly large-scale annotations for document and web images. We begin with a self-supervised pretraining stage on unlabeled images, followed by a supervised autoregressive pretraining stage, where the model learns tasks like parsing and localization from limited, high-quality data. Within the supervised stage, we adopt two strategies to improve our encoder's alignment with both general visual knowledge and diverse document and web agentic tasks: (i) We introduce a novel model-merging scheme, combining encoders trained with different text decoders to ensure broad compatibility with different web agentic architectures. (ii) We use ensemble training to fuse features from pretrained generalist encoders (e.g., SigLIP2) with our own document and web-specific representations. Extensive experiments on classic document tasks, VQAs, web localization, and agent-based benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing DAVE as a strong vision encoder for document and web applications.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17221v3", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.9862, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D

{"title": "SoulX-LiveTalk: Real-Time Infinite Streaming of Audio-Driven Avatars via Self-Correcting Bidirectional Distillation", "author": "Le Shen and Qiao Qian and Tan Yu and Ke Zhou and Tianhang Yu and Yu Zhan and Zhenjie Wang and Ming Tao and Shunshun Yin and Siyuan Liu", "abstract": "Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \\textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \\textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \\textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \\textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23379v2", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.9527, "topK": [{"title": "Synthesizing

{"title": "ShowUI-$\u03c0$: Flow-based Generative Models as GUI Dexterous Hands", "author": "Siyuan Hu and Kevin Qinghong Lin and Mike Zheng Shou", "abstract": "Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$\u03c0$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$\u03c0$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world.

We pinpoint two core causes of this failure: the absence of region-adaptive attention and inflexible token budgets that force uniform downsampling, leading to critical information loss. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Zoomer, a visual prompting framework that delivers token-efficient, detail-preserving image representations for black-box MLLMs. Zoomer integrates (1) a prompt-aware emphasis module to highlight semantically relevant regions, (2) a spatial-preserving orchestration schema to maintain object relationships, and (3) a budget-aware strategy to adaptively allocate tokens between global context and local details. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks and three commercial MLLMs demonstrate that Zoomer boosts accuracy by up to 27% while cutting image token usage by up to 67%. Our approach establishes a principled methodology for robust, resource-aware multimodal understanding in settings where model internals are inaccessible.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00742v2",

{"title": "GenZ: Foundational models as latent variable generators within traditional statistical models", "author": "Marko Jojic and Nebojsa Jojic", "abstract": "We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24834v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.8183, "topK": [{"title": "Genie: Generative Interactive Environments", "link":

In this work, we investigate the challenge of contextual and temporal comprehension in video-language models by exploring the task of temporal localization in videos. To address this problem, prior works have developed complex task-specific architectures, novel modules to embed time into MLLMs, or leveraged additional input signals such as video transcripts to best encode contextual and temporal information. We find that most of these efforts are surpassed by a much simpler design. We introduce Chrono, a universal sequence blueprint that can be applied to any image-text pretrained MLLM. In extensive experiments spanning different MLLM architectures and sizes, finetuning and zero-shot settings, we demonstrate new state-of-the-art results in moment retrieval on the widely used benchmarks Charades-STA, QVHighlights, and ActivityNet Captions, as well as in grounded video question answering on NExT-GQA.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18113v6", "date": "2025-12-31",

{"title": "Hierarchical Deformation Planning and Neural Tracking for DLOs in Constrained Environments", "author": "Yunxi Tang and Tianqi Yang and Jing Huang and Xiangyu Chu and Kwok Wai Samuel Au", "abstract": "Deformable linear objects (DLOs) manipulation presents significant challenges due to DLOs' inherent high-dimensional state space and complex deformation dynamics. The wide-populated obstacles in realistic workspaces further complicate DLO manipulation, necessitating efficient deformation planning and robust deformation tracking. In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, ensuring reliable performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking. Specifically, the deformation planner begins by generating a spatial path set that inherently satisfies the homotopic constraints associated with DLO keypoint paths. Next, a path-set-guided optimization method is applied to synthesize an optimal temporal deformation sequence for the DLO. In manipulation execution, a neural model predictive control approach, leveraging a data-driven deformation model, is designed to accurately track the planned DLO deformation sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in extensive constrained DLO manipulation tasks.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24974v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.7776,

While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24952v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.7749, "topK": [{"title": "GeneVA: A Dataset of Human Annotations for

{"title": "Towards Generalisable Foundation Models for Brain MRI", "author": "Moona Mazher and Geoff J. M. Parker and Daniel C. Alexander", "abstract": "Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.", "link":

{"title": "Large Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Languages: A Survey", "author": "Marian Lupascu and Ana-Cristina Rogoz and Mihai Sorin Stupariu and Radu Tudor Ionescu", "abstract": "In this survey, we systematically analyze techniques used to adapt large multimodal models (LMMs) for low-resource (LR) languages, examining approaches ranging from visual enhancement and data creation to cross-modal transfer and fusion strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of 117 studies across 96 LR languages, we identify key patterns in how researchers tackle the challenges of limited data and computational resources. We categorize works into resource-oriented and method-oriented contributions, further dividing contributions into relevant sub-categories. We compare method-oriented contributions in terms of performance and efficiency, discussing benefits and limitations of representative studies. We find that visual information often serves as a crucial bridge for improving model performance in LR settings, though significant challenges remain in areas such as hallucination mitigation and computational efficiency. In summary, we provide researchers with a clear understanding of current approaches and remaining challenges in making LMMs more accessible to speakers of LR (understudied) languages.

{"title": "FineTec: Fine-Grained Action Recognition Under Temporal Corruption via Skeleton Decomposition and Sequence Completion", "author": "Dian Shao and Mingfei Shi and Like Liu", "abstract": "Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

{"title": "ReVision: A Dataset and Baseline VLM for Privacy-Preserving Task-Oriented Visual Instruction Rewriting", "author": "Abhijit Mishra and Mingda Li and Hsiang Fu and Richard Noh and Minji Kim", "abstract": "Efficient and privacy-preserving multimodal interaction is essential as AR, VR, and modern smartphones with powerful cameras become primary interfaces for human-computer communication. Existing powerful large vision-language models (VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability. This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data privacy. To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across 14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. Experimental results, evaluated through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model (<500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14780v2", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy":

Lee and Tan Lee and Peng Han", "abstract": "Online exams conducted via video conferencing platforms such as Zoom have become widespread, yet ensuring exam integrity remains challenging due to the difficulty of monitoring multiple video feeds in real time. We present iExam, an online exam proctoring and analysis system that combines lightweight real-time face detection with deep face recognition for postexam analysis. iExam assists invigilators by monitoring student presence during exams and identifies abnormal behaviors, such as face disappearance, face rotation, and identity substitution, from recorded videos. The system addresses three key challenges: (i)efficient real-time video capture and analysis, (ii) automated student identity labeling using enhanced OCR on dynamic Zoom name tags, and (iii) resource-efficient training and inference on standard teacher devices. Extensive experiments show that iExam achieves 90.4% accuracy in real-time face detection and 98.4% accuracy in post-exam recognition with low overhead, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for online exam proctoring.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13356v3", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.5846, "topK": [{"title": "Flexible Visual Recognition by Evidential

{"title": "Explaining Object Detectors via Collective Contribution of Pixels", "author": "Toshinori Yamauchi and Hiroshi Kera and Kazuhiko Kawamoto", "abstract": "Visual explanations for object detectors are crucial for enhancing their reliability. Object detectors identify and localize instances by assessing multiple visual features collectively. When generating explanations, overlooking these collective influences in detections may lead to missing compositional cues or capturing spurious correlations. However, existing methods typically focus solely on individual pixel contributions, neglecting the collective contribution of multiple pixels. To address this limitation, we propose a game-theoretic method based on Shapley values and interactions to explicitly capture both individual and collective pixel contributions. Our method provides explanations for both bounding box localization and class determination, highlighting regions crucial for detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method identifies important regions more accurately than state-of-the-art methods.

{"title": "HiGR: Efficient Generative Slate Recommendation via Hierarchical Planning and Multi-Objective Preference Alignment", "author": "Yunsheng Pang and Zijian Liu and Yudong Li and Shaojie Zhu and Zijian Luo and Chenyun Yu and Sikai Wu and Shichen Shen and Cong Xu and Bin Wang and Kai Jiang and Hongyong Yu and Chengxiang Zhuo and Zang Li", "abstract": "Slate recommendation, where users are presented with a ranked list of items simultaneously, is widely adopted in online platforms. Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24787v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.562, "topK": [{"title": "UGG: Unified Generative Grasping",

{"title": "Dream2Flow: Bridging Video Generation and Open-World Manipulation with 3D Object Flow", "author": "Karthik Dharmarajan and Wenlong Huang and Jiajun Wu and Li Fei-Fei and Ruohan Zhang", "abstract": "Generative video modeling has emerged as a compelling tool to zero-shot reason about plausible physical interactions for open-world manipulation. Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24793v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.5174, "topK": [{"title": "Self-supervised Photographic Image Layout Representation Learning", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03740v1", "similarity": 0.5307}, {"title": "TAMM: TriAdapter Multi-Modal Learning for 3D Shape Understanding", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18490v1", "similarity": 0.5042}, {"title": "Boosted dynamic neural networks", "link": "https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26302", "similarity": 0.4756}], "mailto": "mailto:haoxiang.li.2024@gmail.com?subject=%5BarXrec%5D%20Self-Supervised%20Neural%20Architecture%20Search%20for%20Multimodal%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks&body=Title%3A%20Self-Supervised%20Neural%20Architecture%20Search%20for%20Multimodal%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks%0AAuthor%3A%20Shota%20Suzuki%20and%20Satoshi%20Ono%0AAbstract%3A%20Neural%20architecture%20search%20%28NAS%29%2C%20which%20automates%20the%20architectural%20design%20process%20of%20deep%20neural%20networks%20%28DNN%29%2C%20has%20attracted%20increasing%20attention.%20Multimodal%20DNNs%20that%20necessitate%20feature%20fusion%20from%20multiple%20modalities%20benefit%20from%20NAS%20due%20to%20their%20structural%20complexity%3B%20however%2C%20constructing%20an%20architecture%20for%20multimodal%20DNNs%20through%20NAS%20requires%20a%20substantial%20amount%20of%20labeled%20training%20data.%20Thus%2C%20this%20paper%20proposes%20a%20self-supervised%20learning%20%28SSL%29%20method%20for%20architecture%20search%20of%20multimodal%20DNNs.%20The%20proposed%20method%20applies%20SSL%20comprehensively%20for%20both%20the%20architecture%20search%20and%20model%20pretraining%20processes.%20Experimental%20results%20demonstrated%20that%20the%20proposed%20method%20successfully%20designed%20architectures%20for%20DNNs%20from%20unlabeled%20training%20data.%0ALink%3A%20http%3A//arxiv.org/abs/2512.24793v1%0AForm%3A%20https%3A//docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSfFqShId9ssA7GWYmvv7m_7qsIao4K__1rDj9BurNNxUPYQ/viewform%3Fentry.1380929848%3DSelf-Supervised%2520Neural%2520Architecture%2520Search%2520for%2520Multimodal%2520Deep%2520Neural%2520Networks%26entry.906535625%3DShota%2520Suzuki%2520and%2520Satoshi%2520Ono%26entry.1292438233%3DNeural%2520architecture%2520search%2520%2528NAS%2529%252C%2520which%2520automates%2520the%2520architectural%2520design%2520process%2520of%2520deep%2520neural%2520networks%2520%2528DNN%2529%252C%2520has%2520attracted%2520increasing%2520attention.%2520Multimodal%2520DNNs%2520that%2520necessitate%2520feature%2520fusion%2520from%2520multiple%2520modalities%2520benefit%2520from%2520NAS%2520due%2520to%2520their%2520structural%2520complexity%253B%2520however%252C%2520constructing%2520an%2520architecture%2520for%2520multimodal%2520DNNs%2520through%2520NAS%2520requires%2520a%2520substantial%2520amount%2520of%2520labeled%2520training%2520data.%2520Thus%252C%2520this%2520paper%2520proposes%2520a%2520self-supervised%2520learning%2520%2528SSL%2529%2520method%2520for%2520architecture%2520search%2520of%2520multimodal%2520DNNs.%2520The%2520proposed%2520method%2520applies%2520SSL%2520comprehensively%2520for%2520both%2520the%2520architecture%2520search%2520and%2520model%2520pretraining%2520processes.%2520Experimental%2520results%2520demonstrated%2520that%2520the%2520proposed%2520method%2520successfully%2520designed%2520architectures%2520for%2520DNNs%2520from%2520unlabeled%2520training%2520data.%26entry.1838667208%3Dhttp%253A//arxiv.org/abs/2512.24793v1%26entry.124074799%3DRead", "form": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSfFqShId9ssA7GWYmvv7m_7qsIao4K__1rDj9BurNNxUPYQ/viewform?entry.1380929848=Self-Supervised%20Neural%20Architecture%20Search%20for%20Multimodal%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks&entry.906535625=Shota%20Suzuki%20and%20Satoshi%20Ono&entry.1292438233=Neural%20architecture%20search%20%28NAS%29%2C%20which%20automates%20the%20architectural%20design%20process%20of%20deep%20neural%20networks%20%28DNN%29%2C%20has%20attracted%20increasing%20attention.%20Multimodal%20DNNs%20that%20necessitate%20feature%20fusion%20from%20multiple%20modalities%20benefit%20from%20NAS%20due%20to%20their%20structural%20complexity%3B%20however%2C%20constructing%20an%20architecture%20for%20multimodal%20DNNs%20through%20NAS%20requires%20a%20substantial%20amount%20of%20labeled%20training%20data.%20Thus%2C%20this%20paper%20proposes%20a%20self-supervised%20learning%20%28SSL%29%20method%20for%20architecture%20search%20of%20multimodal%20DNNs.%20The%20proposed%20method%20applies%20SSL%20comprehensively%20for%20both%20the%20architecture%20search%20and%20model%20pretraining%20processes.%20Experimental%20results%20demonstrated%20that%20the%20proposed%20method%20successfully%20designed%20architectures%20for%20DNNs%20from%20unlabeled%20training%20data.&entry.1838667208=http%3A//arxiv.org/abs/2512.24793v1&entry.124074799=Read"},

Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel \"Embedding-to-Label\" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24763v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy":

{"title": "Bi-C2R: Bidirectional Continual Compatible Representation for Re-indexing Free Lifelong Person Re-identification", "author": "Zhenyu Cui and Jiahuan Zhou and Yuxin Peng", "abstract": "Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as \"re-indexing\". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25000v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.4942, "topK": [{"title": "Magic-Me: Identity-Specific

{"title": "SpaceTimePilot: Generative Rendering of Dynamic Scenes Across Space and Time", "author": "Zhening Huang and Hyeonho Jeong and Xuelin Chen and Yulia Gryaditskaya and Tuanfeng Y. Wang and Joan Lasenby and Chun-Hao Huang", "abstract": "We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

{"title": "Edit3r: Instant 3D Scene Editing from Sparse Unposed Images", "author": "Jiageng Liu and Weijie Lyu and Xueting Li and Yejie Guo and Ming-Hsuan Yang", "abstract": "We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25071v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.4823, "topK": [{"title": "CAT3D:

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context.

{"title": "RAIR: A Rule-Aware Benchmark Uniting Challenging Long-Tail and Visual Salience Subset for E-commerce Relevance Assessment", "author": "Chenji Lu and Zhuo Chen and Hui Zhao and Zhenyi Wang and Pengjie Wang and Jian Xu and Bo Zheng", "abstract": "Search relevance plays a central role in web e-commerce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant results on relevance task, existing benchmarks lack sufficient complexity for comprehensive model assessment, resulting in an absence of standardized relevance evaluation metrics across the industry. To address this limitation, we propose Rule-Aware benchmark with Image for Relevance assessment(RAIR), a Chinese dataset derived from real-world scenarios. RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.", "link":

{"title": "ArtiSG: Functional 3D Scene Graph Construction via Human-demonstrated Articulated Objects Manipulation", "author": "Qiuyi Gu and Yuze Sheng and Jincheng Yu and Jiahao Tang and Xiaolong Shan and Zhaoyang Shen and Tinghao Yi and Xiaodan Liang and Xinlei Chen and Yu Wang", "abstract": "3D scene graphs have empowered robots with semantic understanding for navigation and planning, yet they often lack the functional information required for physical manipulation, particularly regarding articulated objects. Existing approaches for inferring articulation mechanisms from static observations are prone to visual ambiguity, while methods that estimate parameters from state changes typically rely on constrained settings such as fixed cameras and unobstructed views. Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors. To bridge this gap, we present ArtiSG, a framework that constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations into structured robotic memory. Our approach leverages a robust articulation data collection pipeline utilizing a portable setup to accurately estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes even under camera ego-motion. We integrate these kinematic priors into a hierarchical and open-vocabulary graph while utilizing interaction data to discover inconspicuous functional elements missed by visual perception. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ArtiSG significantly outperforms baselines in functional element recall and articulation estimation precision. Moreover, we show that the constructed graph serves as a reliable functional memory that effectively guides robots to perform language-directed manipulation tasks in real-world environments containing diverse articulated objects.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24845v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.4673, "topK": [{"title": "RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned Scene Graph via Interactive

{"title": "Deep sequence models tend to memorize geometrically; it is unclear why", "author": "Shahriar Noroozizadeh and Vaishnavh Nagarajan and Elan Rosenfeld and Sanjiv Kumar", "abstract": "Deep sequence models are said to store atomic facts predominantly in the form of associative memory: a brute-force lookup of co-occurring entities. We identify a dramatically different form of storage of atomic facts that we term as geometric memory. Here, the model has synthesized embeddings encoding novel global relationships between all entities, including ones that do not co-occur in training. Such storage is powerful: for instance, we show how it transforms a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn $1$-step navigation task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, as against a lookup of local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical supervisory, architectural, or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, a geometry is learned even when it is more complex than the brute-force lookup.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points out to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery, and unlearning.", "link":

{"title": "A Context-Aware Temporal Modeling through Unified Multi-Scale Temporal Encoding and Hierarchical Sequence Learning for Single-Channel EEG Sleep Staging", "author": "Amirali Vakili and Salar Jahanshiri and Armin Salimi-Badr", "abstract": "Automatic sleep staging is a critical task in healthcare due to the global prevalence of sleep disorders. This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.", "link":

{"title": "Sampling from Gaussian Processes: A Tutorial and Applications in Global Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization", "author": "Bach Do and Nafeezat A. Ajenifuja and Taiwo A. Adebiyi and Ruda Zhang", "abstract": "High-fidelity simulations and physical experiments are essential for engineering analysis and design, yet their high cost often makes two critical tasks--global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and optimization--prohibitively expensive. This limitation motivates the common use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as proxy regression models that provide uncertainty-aware predictions from a limited number of high-quality observations. GPs naturally enable efficient sampling strategies that support informed decision-making under uncertainty by extracting information from a subset of possible functions for the model of interest. However, direct sampling from GPs is inefficient due to their infinite-dimensional nature and the high cost associated with large covariance matrix operations. Despite their popularity in machine learning and statistics communities, sampling from GPs has received little attention in the community of engineering optimization. In this paper, we present the formulation and detailed implementation of two notable sampling methods--random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning--for generating posterior samples from GPs at reduced computational cost. Alternative approaches are briefly described. Importantly, we detail how the generated samples can be applied in GSA, single-objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization. We show successful applications of these sampling methods through a series of numerical examples.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14746v2", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.4413, "topK":

An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24826v1", "date":

{"title": "PoseStreamer: A Multi-modal Framework for 6DoF Pose Estimation of Unseen Moving Objects", "author": "Huiming Yang and Linglin Liao and Fei Ding and Sibo Wang and Zijian Zeng", "abstract": "Six degree of freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for novel objects is a critical task in computer vision, yet it faces significant challenges in high-speed and low-light scenarios where standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur. While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22979v2", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.4247, "topK": [{"title": "Synthesizing Moving People with 3D Control", "link":

{"title": "OpenGround: Active Cognition-based Reasoning for Open-World 3D Visual Grounding", "author": "Wenyuan Huang and Zhao Wang and Zhou Wei and Ting Huang and Fang Zhao and Jian Yang and Zhenyu Zhang", "abstract": "3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes. Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.", "link":

In addition, high-resolution films have not been explored by the open-source methods.We propose HaineiFRDM(Film Restoration Diffusion Model), a film restoration framework, to explore diffusion model's powerful content-understanding ability to help human expert better restore indistinguishable film defects.Specifically, we employ a patch-wise training and testing strategy to make restoring high-resolution films on one 24GB-VRAMR GPU possible and design a position-aware Global Prompt and Frame Fusion Modules.Also, we introduce a global-local frequency module to reconstruct consistent textures among different patches. Besides, we firstly restore a low-resolution result and use it as global residual to mitigate blocky artifacts caused by patching process.Furthermore, we construct a film restoration dataset that contains restored real-degraded films and realistic synthetic data.Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our model in defect restoration ability over existing open-source methods.

{"title": "VLN-MME: Diagnosing MLLMs as Language-guided Visual Navigation agents", "author": "Xunyi Zhao and Gengze Zhou and Qi Wu", "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24851v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.3079, "topK": [{"title":

{"title": "DarkEQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Embodied Question Answering in Low-Light Indoor Environments", "author": "Yohan Park and Hyunwoo Ha and Wonjun Jo and Tae-Hyun Oh", "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24985v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.2974, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual

{"title": "SciceVPR: Stable Cross-Image Correlation Enhanced Model for Visual Place Recognition", "author": "Shanshan Wan and Yingmei Wei and Lai Kang and Tianrui Shen and Haixuan Wang and Yee-Hong Yang", "abstract": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a major challenge for robotics and autonomous systems, with the goal of predicting the location of an image based solely on its visual features. State-of-the-art (SOTA) models extract global descriptors using the powerful foundation model DINOv2 as backbone. These models either explore the cross-image correlation or propose a time-consuming two-stage re-ranking strategy to achieve better performance. However, existing works only utilize the final output of DINOv2, and the current cross-image correlation causes unstable retrieval results. To produce both discriminative and constant global descriptors, this paper proposes stable cross-image correlation enhanced model for VPR called SciceVPR. This model explores the full potential of DINOv2 in providing useful feature representations that implicitly encode valuable contextual knowledge. Specifically, SciceVPR first uses a multi-layer feature fusion module to capture increasingly detailed task-relevant channel and spatial information from the multi-layer output of DINOv2. Secondly, SciceVPR considers the invariant correlation between images within a batch as valuable knowledge to be distilled into the proposed self-enhanced encoder. In this way, SciceVPR can acquire fairly robust global features regardless of domain shifts (e.g., changes in illumination, weather and viewpoint between pictures taken in the same place). Experimental results demonstrate that the base variant, SciceVPR-B, outperforms SOTA one-stage methods with single input on multiple datasets with varying domain conditions. The large variant, SciceVPR-L, performs on par with SOTA two-stage models, scoring over 3% higher in Recall@1 compared to existing models on the challenging Tokyo24/7 dataset.

{"title": "Frequent subgraph-based persistent homology for graph classification", "author": "Xinyang Chen and Ama\u00ebl Broustet and Guoting Chen", "abstract": "Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24917v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.2287, "topK": [{"title": "Self-supervised Photographic Image Layout Representation Learning", "link":

{"title": "Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training", "author": "Andrew Tinits and Stephen Mann", "abstract": "The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.\n  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.2071,

{"title": "AODDiff: Probabilistic Reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth via Diffusion-based Bayesian Inference", "author": "Linhao Fan and Hongqiang Fang and Jingyang Dai and Yong Jiang and Qixing Zhang", "abstract": "High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.", "link":

{"title": "PrivacyBench: A Conversational Benchmark for Evaluating Privacy in Personalized AI", "author": "Srija Mukhopadhyay and Sathwik Reddy and Shruthi Muthukumar and Jisun An and Ponnurangam Kumaraguru", "abstract": "Personalized AI agents rely on access to a user's digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24848v1", "date":

This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.", "link":

Part I: 1-Categories contains 100 fully formalized statement-level tasks, curated into topic families and three difficulty tiers via an LLM-assisted + human grading process. The best model solves 8.25% of tasks at pass@1 (32.50%/4.17%/0.00% by Easy/Medium/High) and 12.00% at pass@4 (50.00%/4.76%/0.00%).

{"title": "Hybrid Learning: A Novel Combination of Self-Supervised and Supervised Learning for Joint MRI Reconstruction and Denoising in Low-Field MRI", "author": "Haoyang Pei and Nikola Janjuvsevic and Renqing Luo and Ding Xia and Xiang Xu and William Moore and Yao Wang and Hersh Chandarana and Li Feng", "abstract": "Deep learning has demonstrated strong potential for MRI reconstruction. However, conventional supervised learning requires high-quality, high-SNR references for network training, which are often difficult or impossible to obtain in different scenarios, particularly in low-field MRI. Self-supervised learning provides an alternative by removing the need for training references, but its reconstruction performance can degrade when the baseline SNR is low. To address these limitations, we propose hybrid learning, a two-stage training framework that integrates self-supervised and supervised learning for joint MRI reconstruction and denoising when only low-SNR training references are available. Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the first stage, self-supervised learning is applied to fully sampled low-SNR data to generate higher-quality pseudo-references. In the second stage, these pseudo-references are used as targets for supervised learning to reconstruct and denoise undersampled noisy data. The proposed technique was evaluated in multiple experiments involving simulated and real low-field MRI in the lung and brain at different field strengths. Hybrid learning consistently improved image quality over both standard self-supervised learning and supervised learning with noisy training references at different acceleration rates, noise levels, and field strengths, achieving higher SSIM and lower NMSE. The hybrid learning approach is effective for both Cartesian and non-Cartesian acquisitions. Hybrid learning provides an effective solution for training deep MRI reconstruction models in the absence of high-SNR references. By improving image quality in low-SNR settings, particularly for low-field MRI, it holds promise for broader clinical adoption of deep learning-based reconstruction methods.", "link":

STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24957v1", "date": "2025-12-31",

Shah and Bo Zhou", "abstract": "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24948v1", "date":

{"title": "Distributed Information Bottleneck Theory for Multi-Modal Task-Aware Semantic Communication", "author": "Yujie Zhou and Cheng Peng and Rulong Wang and Yong Xiao and Yingyu Li and Guangming Shi and Ping Zhang", "abstract": "Semantic communication shifts the focus from bit-level accuracy to task-relevant semantic delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication for next-generation networks. However, existing multi-modal solutions often process all available data modalities indiscriminately, ignoring that their contributions to downstream tasks are often unequal. This not only leads to severe resource inefficiency but also degrades task inference performance due to irrelevant or redundant information. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel task-aware distributed information bottleneck (TADIB) framework, which quantifies the contribution of any set of modalities to given tasks. Based on this theoretical framework, we design a practical coding scheme that intelligently selects and compresses only the most task-relevant modalities at the transmitter. To find the optimal selection and the codecs in the network, we adopt the probabilistic relaxation of discrete selection, enabling distributed encoders to make coordinated decisions with score function estimation and common randomness. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our solution matches or surpasses the inference quality of full-modal baselines while significantly reducing communication and computational costs.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04000v3", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.0959, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to Feel It To Believe It: Multi-Modal Bayesian Inference for\n  Semantic

{"title": "Modeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts", "author": "Nasim Borazjanizadeh and James McClelland", "abstract": "Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25026v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.0951, "topK":

{"title": "Gradient Descent as Implicit EM in Distance-Based Neural Models", "author": "Alan Oursland", "abstract": "Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24780v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.0835, "topK": [{"title": "Boosted dynamic neural networks", "link":

{"title": "Generative Classifiers Avoid Shortcut Solutions", "author": "Alexander C. Li and Ananya Kumar and Deepak Pathak", "abstract": "Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25034v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 2.0738, "topK": [{"title": "Thinking Outside the BBox: Unconstrained Generative Object

Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24903v1", "date":

{"title": "Encyclo-K: Evaluating LLMs with Dynamically Composed Knowledge Statements", "author": "Yiming Liang and Yizhi Li and Yantao Du and Ge Zhang and Jiayi Zhou and Yuchen Wu and Yinzhu Piao and Denghui Cao and Tong Sun and Ziniu Li and Li Du and Bo Lei and Jiaheng Liu and Chenghua Lin and Zhaoxiang Zhang and Wenhao Huang and Jiajun Zhang", "abstract": "Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.", "link":

{"title": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Energy Models: Fast and Interpretable Generative Modeling", "author": "Prithvi Raj", "abstract": "Learning an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down generative model offers a powerful framework for generation across many data modalities. However, it remains unclear how its interpretability can be used to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training time. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents challenges in efficiency and sampling multimodal latent distributions. We propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for generative modeling and introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Energy Model (KAEM) to take advantage of structural and inductive biases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, KAEM enables fast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. With the low dimensionality of the latent space and suitable inductive biases encoded, we demonstrate that importance sampling (IS) becomes a viable, unbiased, and highly efficient posterior sampler. For domains where IS fails, we introduce a strategy based on population-based LMC, decomposing the posterior into a sequence of annealed distributions to improve LMC mixing. KAEM balances common generative modeling trade-offs, offering fast inference, interpretability, and stable training, while being naturally suited to Zettascale Computing hardware.", "link":

In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25070v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy":

{"title": "Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization Framework for Multi-Step LLM Pipeline", "author": "Minjun Zhao and Xinyu Zhang and Shuai Zhang and Deyang Li and Ruifeng Shi", "abstract": "Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.", "link":

{"title": "CropTrack: A Tracking with Re-Identification Framework for Precision Agriculture", "author": "Md Ahmed Al Muzaddid and Jordan A. James and William J. Beksi", "abstract": "Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.", "link":

Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24873v1",

{"title": "Characterization of Transfer Using Multi-task Learning Curves", "author": "Andr\u00e1s Millinghoffer and Bence Bolg\u00e1r and P\u00e9ter Antal", "abstract": "Transfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation

{"title": "SymSeqBench: a unified framework for the generation and analysis of rule-based symbolic sequences and datasets", "author": "Barna Zajzon and Younes Bouhadjar and Maxime Fabre and Felix Schmidt and Noah Ostendorf and Emre Neftci and Abigail Morrison and Renato Duarte", "abstract": "Sequential structure is a key feature of multiple domains of natural cognition and behavior, such as language, movement and decision-making. Likewise, it is also a central property of tasks to which we would like to apply artificial intelligence. It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms. The tool is modular, openly available and accessible to the research community.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24977v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.9442, "topK": [{"title": "RoboEXP:

{"title": "HAROOD: A Benchmark for Out-of-distribution Generalization in Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition", "author": "Wang Lu and Yao Zhu and Jindong Wang", "abstract": "Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR.

We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity.

{"title": "Attribution-Guided Distillation of Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders", "author": "Cristina P. Martin-Linares and Jonathan P. Ling", "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels", "link":

{"title": "Spiking Manifesto", "author": "Eugene Izhikevich", "abstract": "Practically everything computers do is better, faster, and more power-efficient than the brain. For example, a calculator performs numerical computations more energy-efficiently than any human. Yet modern AI models are a thousand times less efficient than the brain. These models rely on larger and larger artificial neural networks (ANNs) to boost their encoding capacity, requiring GPUs to perform large-scale matrix multiplications. In contrast, the brain's spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit factorially explosive encoding capacity and compute through the polychronization of spikes rather than explicit matrix-vector products, resulting in lower energy requirements. This manifesto proposes a paradigm for framing popular AI models in terms of spiking networks and polychronization, and for interpreting spiking activity as nature's way of implementing look-up tables. This suggests a path toward converting AI models into a novel class of architectures with much smaller size yet combinatorially large encoding capacity, offering the promise of a thousandfold improvement in performance.

{"title": "Learning quadratic neural networks in high dimensions: SGD dynamics and scaling laws", "author": "G\u00e9rard Ben Arous and Murat A. Erdogdu and Nuri Mert Vural and Denny Wu", "abstract": "We study the optimization and sample complexity of gradient-based training of a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation function in the high-dimensional regime, where the data is generated as $f_*(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\propto \\sum_{j=1}^{r}\u03bb_j \u03c3\\left(\\langle \\boldsymbol{\u03b8_j}, \\boldsymbol{x}\\rangle\\right), \\boldsymbol{x} \\sim N(0,\\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, $\u03c3$ is the 2nd Hermite polynomial, and $\\lbrace\\boldsymbol\u03b8_j \\rbrace_{j=1}^{r} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions. We consider the extensive-width regime $r \\asymp d^\u03b2$ for $\u03b2\\in [0, 1)$, and assume a power-law decay on the (non-negative) second-layer coefficients $\u03bb_j\\asymp j^{-\u03b1}$ for $\u03b1\\geq 0$. We present a sharp analysis of the SGD dynamics in the feature learning regime, for both the population limit and the finite-sample (online) discretization, and derive scaling laws for the prediction risk that highlight the power-law dependencies on the optimization time, sample size, and model width. Our analysis combines a precise characterization of the associated matrix Riccati differential equation with novel matrix monotonicity arguments to establish convergence guarantees for the infinite-dimensional effective dynamics.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03688v3", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.885, "topK": [{"title": "Boosted dynamic neural networks", "link":

{"title": "MedQARo: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Medical Question Answering in Romanian", "author": "Ana-Cristina Rogoz and Radu Tudor Ionescu and Alexandra-Valentina Anghel and Ionut-Lucian Antone-Iordache and Simona Coniac and Andreea Iuliana Ionescu", "abstract": "Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce MedQARo, the first large-scale medical QA benchmark in Romanian, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 105,880 QA pairs related to cancer patients from two medical centers. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,242 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. MedQARo is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 3,000 work hours to generate the QA pairs. Our benchmark contains both in-domain and cross-domain (cross-center and cross-cancer) test collections, enabling a precise assessment of generalization capabilities. We experiment with four open-source LLMs from distinct families of models on MedQARo. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. We also evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs exposed only through APIs, namely GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform zero-shot models, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on MedQARo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/MedQARo.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16390v3", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.8596, "topK": [{"title": "MEDL-U:

{"title": "DTI-GP: Bayesian operations for drug-target interactions using deep kernel Gaussian processes", "author": "Bence Bolg\u00e1r and Andr\u00e1s Millinghoffer and P\u00e9ter Antal", "abstract": "Precise probabilistic information about drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions is vital for understanding limitations and boosting predictive performance. Gaussian processes (GP) offer a scalable framework to integrate state-of-the-art DTI representations and Bayesian inference, enabling novel operations, such as Bayesian classification with rejection, top-$K$ selection, and ranking. We propose a deep kernel learning-based GP architecture (DTI-GP), which incorporates a combined neural embedding module for chemical compounds and protein targets, and a GP module. The workflow continues with sampling from the predictive distribution to estimate a Bayesian precedence matrix, which is used in fast and accurate selection and ranking operations. DTI-GP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, and it allows (1) the construction of a Bayesian accuracy-confidence enrichment score, (2) rejection schemes for improved enrichment, and (3) estimation and search for top-$K$ selections and ranking with high expected utility.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24810v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.8568, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to

{"title": "Unregularized Linear Convergence in Zero-Sum Game from Preference Feedback", "author": "Shulun Chen and Runlong Zhou and Zihan Zhang and Maryam Fazel and Simon S. Du", "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.", "link":

We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality,

{"title": "CPJ: Explainable Agricultural Pest Diagnosis via Caption-Prompt-Judge with LLM-Judged Refinement", "author": "Wentao Zhang and Tao Fang and Lina Lu and Lifei Wang and Weihe Zhong", "abstract": "Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \\textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \\textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning.

{"title": "Limits of quantum generative models with classical sampling hardness", "author": "Sabrina Herbst and Ivona Brandi\u0107 and Adri\u00e1n P\u00e9rez-Salinas", "abstract": "Sampling tasks have been successful in establishing quantum advantages both in theory and experiments. This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24801v1", "date":

{"title": "Sparse Offline Reinforcement Learning with Corruption Robustness", "author": "Nam Phuong Tran and Andi Nika and Goran Radanovic and Long Tran-Thanh and Debmalya Mandal", "abstract": "We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24768v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.8309, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to

{"title": "On the geometry and topology of representations: the manifolds of modular addition", "author": "Gabriela Moisescu-Pareja and Gavin McCracken and Harley Wiltzer and Vincent L\u00e9tourneau and Colin Daniels and Doina Precup and Jonathan Love", "abstract": "The Clock and Pizza interpretations, associated with architectures differing in either uniform or learnable attention, were introduced to argue that different architectural designs can yield distinct circuits for modular addition. In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25060v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.8236, "topK": [{"title": "TAMM: TriAdapter Multi-Modal Learning for 3D Shape

{"title": "Concentration Inequalities for Stochastic Optimization of Unbounded Objective Functions with Application to Denoising Score Matching", "author": "Jeremiah Birrell", "abstract": "We derive novel concentration inequalities that bound the statistical error for a large class of stochastic optimization problems, focusing on the case of unbounded objective functions. Our derivations utilize the following key tools: 1) A new form of McDiarmid's inequality that is based on sample-dependent one-component mean-difference bounds and which leads to a novel uniform law of large numbers result for unbounded functions. 2) A new Rademacher complexity bound for families of functions that satisfy an appropriate sample-dependent Lipschitz property, which allows for application to a large class of distributions with unbounded support. As an application of these results, we derive statistical error bounds for denoising score matching (DSM), an application that inherently requires one to consider unbounded objective functions and distributions with unbounded support, even in cases where the data distribution has bounded support. In addition, our results quantify the benefit of sample-reuse in algorithms that employ easily-sampled auxiliary random variables in addition to the training data, e.g., as in DSM, which uses auxiliary Gaussian random variables.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08628v2", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.8178, "topK": [{"title": "Tuning-Free Noise Rectification for High Fidelity

{"title": "From Inpainting to Editing: A Self-Bootstrapping Framework for Context-Rich Visual Dubbing", "author": "Xu He and Haoxian Zhang and Hejia Chen and Changyuan Zheng and Liyang Chen and Songlin Tang and Jiehui Huang and Xiaoqiang Liu and Pengfei Wan and Zhiyong Wu", "abstract": "Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.", "link":

{"title": "Coordinated Humanoid Manipulation with Choice Policies", "author": "Haozhi Qi and Yen-Jen Wang and Toru Lin and Brent Yi and Yi Ma and Koushil Sreenath and Jitendra Malik", "abstract": "Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25072v1",

{"title": "Spectral Graph Neural Networks for Cognitive Task Classification in fMRI Connectomes", "author": "Debasis Maji and Arghya Banerjee and Debaditya Barman", "abstract": "Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\\%.

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24880v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.7975, "topK": [{"title": "Boosted dynamic neural networks", "link":

{"title": "AI-Driven Cloud Resource Optimization for Multi-Cluster Environments", "author": "Vinoth Punniyamoorthy and Akash Kumar Agarwal and Bikesh Kumar and Abhirup Mazumder and Kabilan Kannan and Sumit Saha", "abstract": "Modern cloud-native systems increasingly rely on multi-cluster deployments to support scalability, resilience, and geographic distribution. However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.", "link":

{"title": "Toward Robust Legal Text Formalization into Defeasible Deontic Logic using LLMs", "author": "Elias Horner and Cristinel Mateis and Guido Governatori and Agata Ciabattoni", "abstract": "We present a comprehensive approach to the automated formalization of legal texts using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). Our method employs a structured pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets, extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic coherence. We introduce a refined success metric that more precisely captures the completeness of formalizations, and a novel two-stage pipeline with a dedicated refinement step to improve logical consistency and coverage. The evaluation procedure has been strengthened with stricter error assessment, and we provide comparative results across multiple LLM configurations, including newly released models and various prompting and fine-tuning strategies. Experiments on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code demonstrate that, when guided effectively, LLMs can produce formalizations that align closely with expert-crafted representations, underscoring their potential for scalable legal informatics.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08899v3", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.7894, "topK":

{"title": "Discovery and inference beyond linearity by integrating Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley values", "author": "Giorgio Spadaccini and Marjolein Fokkema and Mark A. van de Wiel", "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for hypothesis-free discovery of risk and protective factors in healthcare studies. ML is strong at discovering nonlinearities and interactions, but this power is compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although Shapley values provide local measures of features' effects, valid uncertainty quantification for these effects is typically lacking, thus precluding statistical inference. We propose RuleSHAP, a framework that addresses this limitation by combining a dedicated Bayesian sparse regression model with a new tree-based rule generator and Shapley value attribution. RuleSHAP provides detection of nonlinear and interaction effects with uncertainty quantification at the individual level. We derive an efficient formula for computing marginal Shapley values within this framework. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on simulated data. Finally, we apply RuleSHAP to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00571v2", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.777, "topK": [{"title": "You've Got to Feel It To Believe It:

Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures. We evaluate R$^2$CCL on two 8-GPU H100 InfiniBand servers and via large-scale ML simulators modeling hundreds of GPUs with diverse failure patterns. Experiments show that R$^2$CCL is highly robust to NIC failures, incurring less than 1\\% training and less than 3\\% inference overheads. R$^2$CCL outperforms baselines AdapCC and DejaVu by 12.18$\\times$ and 47$\\times$, respectively.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25059v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.7544, "topK":

{"title": "CritiFusion: Semantic Critique and Spectral Alignment for Faithful Text-to-Image Generation", "author": "ZhenQi Chen and TsaiChing Ni and YuanFu Yang", "abstract": "Recent text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity but often struggle with semantic alignment to complex prompts. We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.", "link":

Rao and Barnaby van Straaten and Valentin John and C\u00e9cile X. Yu and Stefan D. Oosterhout and Lucas Stehouwer and Giordano Scappucci and M. D. Stewart, and Menno Veldhorst and Francesco Borsoi and Justyna P. Zwolak", "abstract": "The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$\u03bc$\\si{\\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \\pm 38)$~\\si{\\nano\\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit

{"title": "Symmetric Linear Bandits with Hidden Symmetry", "author": "Nam Phuong Tran and The Anh Ta and Debmalya Mandal and Long Tran-Thanh", "abstract": "High-dimensional linear bandits with low-dimensional structure have received considerable attention in recent studies due to their practical significance. The most common structure in the literature is sparsity. However, it may not be available in practice. Symmetry, where the reward is invariant under certain groups of transformations on the set of arms, is another important inductive bias in the high-dimensional case that covers many standard structures, including sparsity. In this work, we study high-dimensional symmetric linear bandits where the symmetry is hidden from the learner, and the correct symmetry needs to be learned in an online setting. We examine the structure of a collection of hidden symmetry and provide a method based on model selection within the collection of low-dimensional subspaces. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $ O(d_0^{2/3} T^{2/3} \\log(d))$, where $d$ is the ambient dimension which is potentially very large, and $d_0$ is the dimension of the true low-dimensional subspace such that $d_0 \\ll d$. With an extra assumption on well-separated models, we can further improve the regret to $ O(d_0\\sqrt{T\\log(d)} )$.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13899v3", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy":

{"title": "Basic Inequalities for First-Order Optimization with Applications to Statistical Risk Analysis", "author": "Seunghoon Paik and Kangjie Zhou and Matus Telgarsky and Ryan J. Tibshirani", "abstract": "We introduce \\textit{basic inequalities} for first-order iterative optimization algorithms, forming a simple and versatile framework that connects implicit and explicit regularization. While related inequalities appear in the literature, we isolate and highlight a specific form and develop it as a well-rounded tool for statistical analysis. Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $\u03b8_0$ with current iterate $\u03b8_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(\u03b8_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $\u03b8_0$, $\u03b8_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24999v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.6872, "topK":

However, this presents inherent challenges in curriculum development: the field's rapid evolution from both academia and industry, and the need to foster critical thinking beyond traditional technical training. We introduce our course on Ethical Aspects in NLP and our pedagogical approach, grounded in active learning through interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and \"learning by teaching\" methods. Over four years, the course has been refined and adapted across different institutions, educational levels, and interdisciplinary backgrounds; it has also yielded many reusable products, both in the form of teaching materials and in the form of actual educational products aimed at diverse audiences, made by the students themselves. By sharing our approach and experience, we hope to provide inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula.", "link":

{"title": "IDT: A Physically Grounded Transformer for Feed-Forward Multi-View Intrinsic Decomposition", "author": "Kang Du and Yirui Guan and Zeyu Wang", "abstract": "Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \\textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23667v2", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.6781, "topK":

{"title": "Vulcan: Instance-Optimal Systems Heuristics Through LLM-Driven Search", "author": "Rohit Dwivedula and Divyanshu Saxena and Sujay Yadalam and Daehyeok Kim and Aditya Akella", "abstract": "Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.\n  We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.\n  We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in

However, since these architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs, they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction. Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under

{"title": "A study on constraint extraction and exception exclusion in care worker scheduling", "author": "Koki Suenaga and Tomohiro Furuta and Satoshi Ono", "abstract": "Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24853v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.2064, "topK": [{"title": "RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned Scene Graph via

Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous

{"title": "AstroReview: An LLM-driven Multi-Agent Framework for Telescope Proposal Peer Review and Refinement", "author": "Yutong Wang and Yunxiang Xiao and Yonglin Tian and Junyong Li and Jing Wang and Yisheng Lv", "abstract": "Competitive access to modern observatories has intensified as proposal volumes outpace available telescope time, making timely, consistent, and transparent peer review a critical bottleneck for the advancement of astronomy. Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stages: (i) novelty and scientific merit, (ii) feasibility and expected yield, and (iii) meta-review and reliability verification. Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24754v1",

{"title": "The Impact of LLMs on Online News Consumption and Production", "author": "Hangcheng Zhao and Ron Berman", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news \"slop.\" Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.\n  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.\n  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.", "link":

{"title": "MSACL: Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates for Exponentially Stabilizing Control", "author": "Yongwei Zhang and Yuanzhe Xing and Quan Quan and Zhikun She", "abstract": "Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\u03bb$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control.

{"title": "Semi-overlapping Multi-bandit Best Arm Identification for Sequential Support Network Learning", "author": "Andr\u00e1s Antos and Andr\u00e1s Millinghoffer and P\u00e9ter Antal", "abstract": "Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.\n  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.\n  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24959v1", "date": "2025-12-31", "relevancy": 1.6135,
