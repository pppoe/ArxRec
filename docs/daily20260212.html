{"title": "LighthouseGS: Indoor Structure-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for Panorama-Style Mobile Captures", "author": "Seungoh Han and Jaehoon Jang and Hyunsu Kim and Jaeheung Surh and Junhyung Kwak and Hyowon Ha and Kyungdon Joo", "abstract": "We introduce LighthouseGS, a practical novel view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes simple panorama-style captures from a single mobile device. While convenient, this rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To address these challenges, LighthouseGS leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and monocular depth estimation, and utilizes indoor planar structures. Specifically, we propose a new initialization method called plane scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures, followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization stability. Additionally, we present geometric and photometric corrections to resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices. Tested on real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers photorealistic rendering, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and enabling applications like panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

{"title": "DMP-3DAD: Cross-Category 3D Anomaly Detection via Realistic Depth Map Projection with Few Normal Samples", "author": "Zi Wang and Katsuya Hotta and Koichiro Kamide and Yawen Zou and Jianjian Qin and Chao Zhang and Jun Yu", "abstract": "Cross-category anomaly detection for 3D point clouds aims to determine whether an unseen object belongs to a target category using only a few normal examples. Most existing methods rely on category-specific training, which limits their flexibility in few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose DMP-3DAD, a training-free framework for cross-category 3D anomaly detection based on multi-view realistic depth map projection. Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting. The results show that the proposed approach provides a simple yet effective solution for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10806v1", "date":

{"title": "LaSSM: Efficient Semantic-Spatial Query Decoding via Local Aggregation and State Space Models for 3D Instance Segmentation", "author": "Lei Yao and Yi Wang and Yawen Cui and Moyun Liu and Lap-Pui Chau", "abstract": "Query-based 3D scene instance segmentation from point clouds has attained notable performance. However, existing methods suffer from the query initialization dilemma due to the sparse nature of point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in query decoders. We accordingly introduce LaSSM, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer to derive the query set from superpoints by considering both semantic cues and spatial distribution, achieving comprehensive scene coverage and accelerated convergence. We further present a coordinate-guided state space model (SSM) decoder that progressively refines queries. The novel decoder features a local aggregation scheme that restricts the model to focus on geometrically coherent regions and a spatial dual-path SSM block to capture underlying dependencies within the query set by integrating associated coordinates information. Our design enables efficient instance prediction, avoiding the incorporation of noisy information and reducing redundant computation. LaSSM ranks first place on the latest ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard, outperforming the previous best method by 2.5% mAP with only 1/3 FLOPs, demonstrating its superiority in challenging large-scale scene instance segmentation. LaSSM also achieves competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks with less computational cost. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results validate the effectiveness of our design.

{"title": "Splat and Distill: Augmenting Teachers with Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction For 3D-Aware Distillation", "author": "David Shavin and Sagie Benaim", "abstract": "Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have achieved remarkable success when applied to various downstream 2D tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

{"title": "(MGS)$^2$-Net: Unifying Micro-Geometric Scale and Macro-Geometric Structure for Cross-View Geo-Localization", "author": "Minglei Li and Mengfan He and Chao Chen and Ziyang Meng", "abstract": "Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\\% on University-1652 and 97.02\\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\\textbf{U}$ation $\\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ establishes a rigorous standard for $\\textit{GFI}$, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released at: $\\href{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}$.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11144v1", "date": "2026-02-11",

{"title": "HairWeaver: Few-Shot Photorealistic Hair Motion Synthesis with Sim-to-Real Guided Video Diffusion", "author": "Di Chang and Ji Hou and Aljaz Bozic and Assaf Neuberger and Felix Juefei-Xu and Olivier Maury and Gene Wei-Chin Lin and Tuur Stuyck and Doug Roble and Mohammad Soleymani and Stephane Grabli", "abstract": "We present HairWeaver, a diffusion-based pipeline that animates a single human image with realistic and expressive hair dynamics. While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11117v1",

{"title": "SoulX-FlashHead: Oracle-guided Generation of Infinite Real-time Streaming Talking Heads", "author": "Tan Yu and Qian Qiao and Le Shen and Ke Zhou and Jincheng Hu and Dian Sheng and Bo Hu and Haoming Qin and Jun Gao and Changhai Zhou and Shunshun Yin and Siyuan Liu", "abstract": "Achieving a balance between high-fidelity visual quality and low-latency streaming remains a formidable challenge in audio-driven portrait generation. Existing large-scale models often suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight alternatives typically compromise on holistic facial representations and temporal stability. In this paper, we propose SoulX-FlashHead, a unified 1.3B-parameter framework designed for real-time, infinite-length, and high-fidelity streaming video generation. To address the instability of audio features in streaming scenarios, we introduce Streaming-Aware Spatiotemporal Pre-training equipped with a Temporal Audio Context Cache mechanism, which ensures robust feature extraction from short audio fragments. Furthermore, to mitigate the error accumulation and identity drift inherent in long-sequence autoregressive generation, we propose Oracle-Guided Bidirectional Distillation, leveraging ground-truth motion priors to provide precise physical guidance. We also present VividHead, a large-scale, high-quality dataset containing 782 hours of strictly aligned footage to support robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulX-FlashHead achieves state-of-the-art performance on HDTF and VFHQ benchmarks. Notably, our Lite variant achieves an inference speed of 96 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, facilitating ultra-fast interaction without sacrificing visual coherence.", "link":

{"title": "Chatting with Images for Introspective Visual Thinking", "author": "Junfei Wu and Jian Guan and Qiang Liu and Shu Wu and Liang Wang and Wei Wu and Tienie Tan", "abstract": "Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11073v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.9334, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D Scene\n

Richard Yu", "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems.",

Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09843v2", "date": "2026-02-11",

{"title": "Agentic Jigsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing Visual Perception and Reasoning in Vision-Language Models", "author": "Yu Zeng and Wenxuan Huang and Shiting Huang and Xikun Bao and Yukun Qi and Yiming Zhao and Qiuchen Wang and Lin Chen and Zehui Chen and Huaian Chen and Wanli Ouyang and Feng Zhao", "abstract": "Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks, existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion. Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\\times$ 2 setting) but also demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement learning data.

{"title": "Towards Better Code Understanding in Decoder-Only Models with Contrastive Learning", "author": "Jiayi Lin and Yanlin Wang and Yibiao Yang and Lei Zhang and Yutao Xie", "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale code generation models have led to remarkable progress in producing high-quality code. These models are trained in a self-supervised manner on extensive unlabeled code corpora using a decoder-only architecture. However, despite their generative strength, decoder-only models often exhibit limited performance on code understanding tasks such as code search and clone detection, primarily due to their generation-oriented training objectives. While training large encoder-only models from scratch on massive code datasets can improve understanding ability but remains computationally expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we explore a more efficient alternative by transferring knowledge from pre-trained decoder-only code generation models to code understanding tasks. We investigate how decoder-only architectures can be effectively adapted to learn discriminative and semantically meaningful code representations. To this end, we propose CL4D, a contrastive learning framework tailored to strengthen the representation capabilities of decoder-only models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CL4D achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods on representative code understanding tasks, including code search and clone detection. Further analysis reveals that CL4D substantially improves the semantic alignment of code representations by reducing the distance between semantically similar code snippets. These findings highlight the feasibility of leveraging decoder-only models as a unified backbone for both code generation and understanding.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12326v2", "date":

{"title": "ZebraPose: Zebra Detection and Pose Estimation using only Synthetic Data", "author": "Elia Bonetto and Aamir Ahmad", "abstract": "Collecting and labeling large real-world wild animal datasets is impractical, costly, error-prone, and labor-intensive. For animal monitoring tasks, as detection, tracking, and pose estimation, out-of-distribution viewpoints (e.g. aerial) are also typically needed but rarely found in publicly available datasets. To solve this, existing approaches synthesize data with simplistic techniques that then necessitate strategies to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap. Therefore, real images, style constraints, complex animal models, or pre-trained networks are often leveraged. In contrast, we generate a fully synthetic dataset using a 3D photorealistic simulator and demonstrate that it can eliminate such needs for detecting and estimating 2D poses of wild zebras. Moreover, existing top-down 2D pose estimation approaches using synthetic data assume reliable detection models. However, these often fail in out-of-distribution scenarios, e.g. those that include wildlife or aerial imagery. Our method overcomes this by enabling the training of both tasks using the same synthetic dataset. Through extensive benchmarks, we show that models trained from scratch exclusively on our synthetic data generalize well to real images. We perform these using multiple real-world and synthetic datasets, pre-trained and randomly initialized backbones, and different image resolutions.

{"title": "GeoZero: Incentivizing Reasoning from Scratch on Geospatial Scenes", "author": "Di Wang and Shunyu Liu and Wentao Jiang and Fengxiang Wang and Yi Liu and Xiaolei Qin and Zhiming Luo and Chaoyang Zhou and Haonan Guo and Jing Zhang and Bo Du and Dacheng Tao and Liangpei Zhang", "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have undergone rapid development in advancing geospatial scene understanding. Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

{"title": "From Steering to Pedalling: Do Autonomous Driving VLMs Generalize to Cyclist-Assistive Spatial Perception and Planning?", "author": "Krishna Kanth Nakka and Vedasri Nakka", "abstract": "Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.", "link":

We introduce NOVA, a NOn-contrastive Vision-language Alignment framework based on joint embedding prediction with distributional regularization. NOVA aligns visual representations to a frozen, domain-specific text encoder by predicting text embeddings from augmented image views, while enforcing an isotropic Gaussian structure via Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization (SIGReg). This eliminates the need for negative sampling, momentum encoders, or stop-gradients, reducing the training objective to a single hyperparameter. We evaluate NOVA on zeroshot chest X-ray classification using ClinicalBERT as the text encoder and Vision Transformers trained from scratch on MIMIC-CXR. On zero-shot classification across three benchmark datasets, NOVA outperforms multiple standard baselines while exhibiting substantially more consistent training runs. Our results demonstrate that non-contrastive vision-language pretraining offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to contrastive methods.", "link":

{"title": "Unveiling the \"Fairness Seesaw\": Discovering and Mitigating Gender and Race Bias in Vision-Language Models", "author": "Jian Lan and Udo Schlegel and Tanveer Hannan and Gengyuan Zhang and Haokun Chen and Thomas Seidl", "abstract": "Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, the knowledge mechanisms underlying their social biases remain a black box, where fairness- and ethics-related problems harm certain groups of people in society. It is unknown to what extent VLMs yield gender and race bias in generative responses. In this paper, we conduct a systematic discovery of gender and race bias in state-of-the-art VLMs, focusing not only on surface-level responses but also on the internal probability distributions and hidden state dynamics. Our empirical analysis reveals three critical findings: 1) The Fairness Paradox: Models often generate fair text labels while maintaining highly skewed confidence scores (mis-calibration) toward specific social groups. 2) Layer-wise Fluctuation: Fairness knowledge is not uniformly distributed; it peaks in intermediate layers and undergoes substantial knowledge erosion in the final layers. 3) Residual Discrepancy: Within a single hidden layer, different residual streams carry conflicting social knowledge - some reinforcing fairness while others amplifying bias. Leveraging these insights, we propose RES-FAIR (RESidual Flow Adjustment for Inference Recalibration), a post-hoc framework that mitigates bias by localizing and projecting hidden states away from biased residual directions while amplifying fair components. Evaluations on PAIRS and SocialCounterfactuals datasets demonstrate that our discovery-based approach significantly improves response fairness and confidence calibration without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our work provides a new lens for understanding how multi-modal models store and process sensitive social information.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23798v2", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy":

{"title": "Equivariant symmetry-aware head pose estimation for fetal MRI", "author": "Ramya Muthukrishnan and Borjan Gagoski and Aryn Lee and P. Ellen Grant and Elfar Adalsteinsson and Polina Golland and Benjamin Billot", "abstract": "We present E(3)-Pose, a novel fast pose estimation method that jointly and explicitly models rotation equivariance and object symmetry. Our work is motivated by the challenging problem of accounting for fetal head motion during a diagnostic MRI scan. We aim to enable automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices with 6-DoF head pose estimation, supported by 3D MRI volumes rapidly acquired before each 2D slice. Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts. In contrast, E(3)-Pose captures anatomical symmetries and rigid pose equivariance by construction, and yields robust estimates of the fetal head pose. Our experiments on publicly available and representative clinical fetal MRI datasets demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization of our method across domains. Crucially, E(3)-Pose achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on clinical MRI volumes, supporting future clinical translation. Our implementation is publicly available at github.com/MedicalVisionGroup/E3-Pose.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04890v5", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.7194, "topK": [{"title":

{"title": "From Representational Complementarity to Dual Systems: Synergizing VLM and Vision-Only Backbones for End-to-End Driving", "author": "Sining Ang and Yuguang Yang and Chenxu Dang and Canyu Chen and Cheng Chi and Haiyan Liu and Xuanyao Mao and Jason Bao and  Xuliang and Bingchuan Sun and Yan Wang", "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) driving augments end-to-end (E2E) planning with language-enabled backbones, yet it remains unclear what changes beyond the usual accuracy--cost trade-off. We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x.

{"title": "OccFace: Unified Occlusion-Aware Facial Landmark Detection with Per-Point Visibility", "author": "Xinhao Xiang and Zhengxin Li and Saurav Dhakad and Theo Bancroft and Jiawei Zhang and Weiyang Li", "abstract": "Accurate facial landmark detection under occlusion remains challenging, especially for human-like faces with large appearance variation and rotation-driven self-occlusion. Existing detectors typically localize landmarks while handling occlusion implicitly, without predicting per-point visibility that downstream applications can benefits. We present OccFace, an occlusion-aware framework for universal human-like faces, including humans, stylized characters, and other non-human designs. OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap. We also create an occlusion-aware evaluation suite reporting NME on visible vs. occluded landmarks and benchmarking visibility with Occ AP, F1@0.5, and ROC-AUC, together with a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility. Experiments show improved robustness under external occlusion and large head rotations, especially on occluded regions, while preserving accuracy on visible landmarks.", "link":

{"title": "Interpretable Vision Transformers in Image Classification via SVDA", "author": "Vasileios Arampatzakis and George Pavlidis and Nikolaos Mitianoudis and Nikos Papamarkos", "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, yet their attention mechanisms often remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors. In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10994v1", "date": "2026-02-11",

Our MITI Dataset available at [https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1621941] provides all the necessary data by a complete recording of a handheld surgical intervention at Research Hospital Rechts der Isar of TUM. It contains multimodal sensor information from IMU, stereoscopic video, and infrared (IR) tracking as ground truth for evaluation. Furthermore, calibration for the stereoscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, the rigid transformations in the sensor setup, and time-offsets are available. We wisely chose a suitable intervention that contains very few cutting and tissue deformation and shows a full scan of the abdomen with a handheld camera such that it is ideal for testing SLAM algorithms. Intending to promote the progress of visual-inertial algorithms designed for MIS application, we hope that our clinical training dataset helps and enables researchers to enhance algorithms.", "link":

{"title": "Multi-Level Feature Fusion for Continual Learning in Visual Quality Inspection", "author": "Johannes C. Bauer and Paul Geng and Stephan Trattnig and Petr Dokl\u00e1dal and R\u00fcdiger Daub", "abstract": "Deep neural networks show great potential for automating various visual quality inspection tasks in manufacturing. However, their applicability is limited in more volatile scenarios, such as remanufacturing, where the inspected products and defect patterns often change. In such settings, deployed models require frequent adaptation to novel conditions, effectively posing a continual learning problem. To enable quick adaptation, the necessary training processes must be computationally efficient while still avoiding effects like catastrophic forgetting. This work presents a multi-level feature fusion (MLFF) approach that aims to improve both aspects simultaneously by utilizing representations from different depths of a pretrained network. We show that our approach is able to match the performance of end-to-end training for different quality inspection problems while using significantly less trainable parameters. Furthermore, it reduces catastrophic forgetting and improves generalization robustness to new product types or defects.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00725v2", "date": "2026-02-11",

{"title": "VFGS-Net: Frequency-Guided State-Space Learning for Topology-Preserving Retinal Vessel Segmentation", "author": "Ruiqi Song and Lei Liu and Ya-Nan Zhang and Chao Wang and Xiaoning Li and Nan Mu", "abstract": "Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.", "link":

{"title": "Semi-Supervised Cross-Domain Imitation Learning", "author": "Li-Min Chu and Kai-Siang Ma and Ming-Hong Chen and Ping-Chun Hsieh", "abstract": "Cross-domain imitation learning (CDIL) accelerates policy learning by transferring expert knowledge across domains, which is valuable in applications where the collection of expert data is costly. Existing methods are either supervised, relying on proxy tasks and explicit alignment, or unsupervised, aligning distributions without paired data, but often unstable. We introduce the Semi-Supervised CDIL (SS-CDIL) setting and propose the first algorithm for SS-CDIL with theoretical justification. Our method uses only offline data, including a small number of target expert demonstrations and some unlabeled imperfect trajectories. To handle domain discrepancy, we propose a novel cross-domain loss function for learning inter-domain state-action mappings and design an adaptive weight function to balance the source and target knowledge. Experiments on MuJoCo and Robosuite show consistent gains over the baselines, demonstrating that our approach achieves stable and data-efficient policy learning with minimal supervision.

{"title": "PreferThinker: Reasoning-based Personalized Image Preference Assessment", "author": "Shengqi Xu and Xinpeng Zhou and Yabo Zhang and Ming Liu and Tao Liang and Tianyu Zhang and Yalong Bai and Zuxuan Wu and Wangmeng Zuo", "abstract": "Personalized image preference assessment aims to evaluate an individual user's image preferences by relying only on a small set of reference images as prior information. Existing methods mainly focus on general preference assessment, training models with large-scale data to tackle well-defined tasks such as text-image alignment. However, these approaches struggle to handle personalized preference because user-specific data are scarce and not easily scalable, and individual tastes are often diverse and complex. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a common preference profile that serves as a bridge across users, allowing large-scale user data to be leveraged for training profile prediction and capturing complex personalized preferences. Building on this idea, we propose a reasoning-based personalized image preference assessment framework that follows a \\textit{predict-then-assess} paradigm: it first predicts a user's preference profile from reference images, and then provides interpretable, multi-dimensional scores and assessments of candidate images based on the predicted profile. To support this, we first construct a large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-style personalized assessment dataset annotated with diverse user preference profiles and high-quality CoT-style reasoning, enabling explicit supervision of structured reasoning. Next, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase to empower the model with structured reasoning capabilities, followed by reinforcement learning to incentivize the model to explore more reasonable assessment paths and enhance generalization. Furthermore, we propose a similarity-aware prediction reward to encourage better prediction of the user's preference profile, which facilitates more reasonable assessments exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00609v3", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.6191, "topK": [{"title": "Self-supervised

{"title": "FGAA-FPN: Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for Oriented Object Detection", "author": "Jialin Ma", "abstract": "With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and aerial imagery, oriented object detection has become a key capability for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response. However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10710v1",

{"title": "RiemannGL: Riemannian Geometry Changes Graph Deep Learning", "author": "Li Sun and Qiqi Wan and Suyang Zhou and Zhenhao Huang and Philip S. Yu", "abstract": "Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.", "link":

Dennig and Michael Behrisch and Alexandru Telea", "abstract": "Projections (or dimensionality reduction) methods $P$ aim to map high-dimensional data to typically 2D scatterplots for visual exploration. Inverse projection methods $P^{-1}$ aim to map this 2D space to the data space to support tasks such as data augmentation, classifier analysis, and data imputation. Current $P^{-1}$ methods suffer from a fundamental limitation -- they can only generate a fixed surface-like structure in data space, which poorly covers the richness of this space. We address this by a new method that can `sweep' the data space under user control. Our method works generically for any $P$ technique and dataset, is controlled by two intuitive user-set parameters, and is simple to implement. We demonstrate it by an extensive application involving image manipulation for style transfer.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11141v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.5862, "topK":

{"title": "Corruption-Aware Training of Latent Video Diffusion Models for Robust Text-to-Video Generation", "author": "Chika Maduabuchi and Hao Chen and Yujin Han and Jindong Wang", "abstract": "Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative quality for image and video generation; however, they remain brittle under noisy conditioning, where small perturbations in text or multimodal embeddings can cascade over timesteps and cause semantic drift. Existing corruption strategies from image diffusion (e.g., Gaussian, Uniform) fail in video settings because static noise disrupts temporal fidelity. In this paper, we propose CAT-LVDM, a corruption-aware training framework with structured, data-aligned noise injection tailored for video diffusion. Our two operators, Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI) and Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), align perturbations with batch semantics or spectral dynamics to preserve coherence. CAT-LVDM yields substantial gains: BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9 percent on WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN improves UCF-101 by 12.3 percent, outperforming Gaussian, Uniform, and large diffusion baselines such as DEMO (2.3B) and LaVie (3B) despite training on 5x less data. Ablations confirm the unique value of low-rank, data-aligned noise, and theoretical analysis establishes why these operators tighten robustness and generalization bounds. CAT-LVDM thus introduces a principled framework for robust video diffusion and further demonstrates transferability to autoregressive generation and multimodal video understanding models.", "link":

Existing automated solutions typically treat each format as an isolated downstream task, leading to redundant processing and semantic inconsistency. We introduce PaperX, a unified framework that models academic presentation generation as a structural transformation and rendering process. Central to our approach is the Scholar DAG, an intermediate representation that decouples the paper's logical structure from its final presentation syntax. By applying adaptive graph traversal strategies, PaperX generates diverse, high quality outputs from a single source. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves the state of the art performance in content fidelity and aesthetic quality while significantly improving cost efficiency compared to specialized single task agents.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03866v3", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.5529, "topK": [{"title": "UGG: Unified Generative Grasping", "link":

{"title": "Proficient Graph Neural Network Design by Accumulating Knowledge on Large Language Models", "author": "Jialiang Wang and Hanmo Liu and Shimin Di and Zhili Wang and Jiachuan Wang and Lei Chen and Xiaofang Zhou", "abstract": "High-level automation is increasingly critical in AI, driven by rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experience into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well-suited for meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search cost compared to baselines.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06717v3", "date": "2026-02-11",

ContextLM builds a language model on top of context embeddings that span multiple tokens, enabling better next-token prediction by predicting the next context. Our model is fully compatible with standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigms (e.g., perplexity). Extensive experiments with GPT-2 and Pythia backbones (up to 1.5B parameters and 300B training tokens) reveal that ContextLM shifts the Pareto frontier of scaling laws, exhibiting superior efficiency in parameters, training tokens, and FLOPs. Our results show that ContextLM could already achieve the baseline perplexity using 39\\% fewer parameters and demonstrates robust generalization improvements on extensive downstream tasks under equivalent parameter counts.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20280v3", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.5386, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D

{"title": "Natural Hypergradient Descent: Algorithm Design, Convergence Analysis, and Parallel Implementation", "author": "Deyi Kong and Zaiwei Chen and Shuzhong Zhang and Shancong Mou", "abstract": "In this work, we propose Natural Hypergradient Descent (NHGD), a new method for solving bilevel optimization problems. To address the computational bottleneck in hypergradient estimation--namely, the need to compute or approximate Hessian inverse--we exploit the statistical structure of the inner optimization problem and use the empirical Fisher information matrix as an asymptotically consistent surrogate for the Hessian. This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead. Empirical evaluations on representative bilevel learning tasks further demonstrate the practical advantages of NHGD, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in large-scale machine learning

{"title": "A Controlled Study of Double DQN and Dueling DQN Under Cross-Environment Transfer", "author": "Azkaa Nasir and Fatima Dossa and Muhammad Ahmed Atif and Mohammad Shahid Shaikh", "abstract": "Transfer learning in deep reinforcement learning is often motivated by improved stability and reduced training cost, but it can also fail under substantial domain shift. This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09810v2", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.4896, "topK": [{"title": "Safe and efficient training of a control agent", "link":

{"title": "ContactGaussian-WM: Learning Physics-Grounded World Model from Videos", "author": "Meizhong Wang and Wanxin Jin and Kun Cao and Lihua Xie and Yiguang Hong", "abstract": "Developing world models that understand complex physical interactions is essential for advancing robotic planning and simulation.However, existing methods often struggle to accurately model the environment under conditions of data scarcity and complex contact-rich dynamic motion.To address these challenges, we propose ContactGaussian-WM, a differentiable physics-grounded rigid-body world model capable of learning intricate physical laws directly from sparse and contact-rich video sequences.Our framework consists of two core components: (1) a unified Gaussian representation for both visual appearance and collision geometry, and (2) an end-to-end differentiable learning framework that differentiates through a closed-form physics engine to infer physical properties from sparse visual observations.Extensive simulations and real-world evaluations demonstrate that ContactGaussian-WM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in learning complex scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.Furthermore, we showcase the practical utility of our framework in downstream applications, including data synthesis and real-time MPC.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11021v1",

{"title": "EvoXplain: When Machine Learning Models Agree on Predictions but Disagree on Why -- Measuring Mechanistic Multiplicity Across Training Runs", "author": "Chama Bensmail", "abstract": "Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. This assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different and potentially competing mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing the explanation of a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the training and model selection pipeline itself, without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles. It examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanatory basin or separate into multiple structured explanatory basins. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Adult Income and Breast Cancer datasets using deep neural networks and Logistic Regression. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, explanation stability differs across pipelines. Deep neural networks on Breast Cancer converge to a single explanatory basin, while the same architecture on Adult Income separates into distinct explanatory basins despite identical training conditions. Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer exhibits conditional multiplicity, where basin accessibility is controlled by regularisation configuration. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a correct explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory structure visible and quantifiable, revealing when single instance explanations obscure the existence of multiple admissible predictive mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of the training pipeline under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.", "link":

{"title": "HyperAIRI: a plug-and-play algorithm for precise hyperspectral image reconstruction in radio interferometry", "author": "Chao Tang and Arwa Dabbech and Adrian Jackson and Yves Wiaux", "abstract": "The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure (FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularization step via learned denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension, underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighboring channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained with a Jacobian regularization enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a variant of the optimization-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity across spectral channels via the $\\ell_{2,1}$-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its superior performance compared to its optimization-based counterpart Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.",

{"title": "Ecological mapping with geospatial foundation models", "author": "Craig Mahlasi and Gciniwe S. Baloyi and Zaheed Gaffoor and Levente Klein and Anne Jones and Etienne Vos and Michal Muszynski and Geoffrey Dawson and Campbell Watson", "abstract": "Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) are a fast-emerging paradigm for various geospatial tasks, such as ecological mapping. However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities. We note that these models would benefit from higher resolution and more accurate labels, especially for use cases where pixel-level dynamics need to be mapped.", "link":

Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05052v2", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.4675, "topK": [{"title":

{"title": "The Label Horizon Paradox: Rethinking Supervision Targets in Financial Forecasting", "author": "Chen-Hui Song and Shuoling Liu and Liyuan Chen", "abstract": "While deep learning has revolutionized financial forecasting through sophisticated architectures, the design of the supervision signal itself is rarely scrutinized. We challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, uncovering the Label Horizon Paradox: the optimal supervision signal often deviates from the prediction goal, shifting across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics. We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run. Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, thereby opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03395v3", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.4546, "topK": [{"title": "Boosted dynamic neural networks", "link":

{"title": "Proactive Local-Minima-Free Robot Navigation: Blending Motion Prediction with Safe Control", "author": "Yifan Xue and Ze Zhang and Knut \u00c5kesson and Nadia Figueroa", "abstract": "This work addresses the challenge of safe and efficient mobile robot navigation in complex dynamic environments with concave moving obstacles. Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions. The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.",

{"title": "Orion-Bix: Bi-Axial Attention for Tabular In-Context Learning", "author": "Mohamed Bouadi and Pratinav Seth and Aditya Tanna and Vinay Kumar Sankarapu", "abstract": "Tabular data drive most real-world machine learning applications, yet building general-purpose models for them remains difficult. Mixed numeric and categorical fields, weak feature structure, and limited labeled data make scaling and generalization challenging. To this end, we introduce Orion-Bix, a tabular foundation model that combines biaxial attention with meta-learned in-context reasoning for few-shot tabular learning. Its encoder alternates standard, grouped, hierarchical, and relational attention, fusing their outputs through multi-CLS summarization to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. A label-aware ICL head adapts on the fly and scales to large label spaces via hierarchical decision routing. Meta-trained on synthetically generated, structurally diverse tables with causal priors, Orion-Bix learns transferable inductive biases across heterogeneous data. Delivered as a scikit-learn compatible foundation model, it outperforms gradient-boosting baselines and remains competitive with state-of-the-art tabular foundation models on public benchmarks, showing that biaxial attention with episodic meta-training enables robust, few-shot-ready tabular learning.

{"title": "MOTGNN: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Omics Disease Classification", "author": "Tiantian Yang and Zhiqian Chen", "abstract": "Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality of multi-omics data, the heterogeneity across modalities, and the lack of reliable biological interaction networks make meaningful integration challenging. In addition, many existing models rely on handcrafted similarity graphs, are vulnerable to class imbalance, and often lack built-in interpretability, limiting their usefulness in biomedical applications. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. Across three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance. The model maintains computational efficiency through the use of sparse graphs and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight the potential of MOTGNN to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07465v2", "date":

{"title": "Is In-Context Learning Learning?", "author": "Adrian de Wynter", "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue that, mathematically, ICL fits the definition of learning; however, its full characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that, empirically, ICL is limited in its ability to learn and generalise to unseen tasks. Namely, in the limit where exemplars become more numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity, especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied accuracies and on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding is not a robust mechanism for learning, and suggests limited all-purpose generalisability.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10414v4", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.4387, "topK": [{"title": "IAE: Implicit Autoencoder for Point Cloud Self-supervised Representation

{"title": "An Indoor Radio Mapping Dataset Combining 3D Point Clouds and RSSI", "author": "Ljupcho Milosheski and Kuon Akiyama and Bla\u017e Bertalani\u010d and Jernej Hribar and Ryoichi Shinkuma", "abstract": "The growing number of smart devices supporting bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time video analytics, smart sensing, Extended Reality (XR), etc., necessitates reliable wireless connectivity in indoor environments. In such environments, accurate design of Radio Environment Maps (REMs) enables adaptive wireless network planning and optimization of Access Point (AP) placement. However, generating realistic REMs remains difficult due to the variability of indoor environments and the limitations of existing modeling approaches, which often rely on simplified layouts or fully synthetic data. These challenges are further amplified by the adoption of next-generation Wi-Fi standards, which operate at higher frequencies and suffer from limited range and wall penetration. To support the efforts in addressing these challenges, we collected a dataset that combines high-resolution 3D LiDAR scans with Wi-Fi RSSI measurements collected across 20 setups in a multi-room indoor environment. The dataset includes two measurement scenarios, the first without human presence in the environment, and the second with human presence, enabling the development and validation of REM estimation models that incorporate physical geometry and environmental dynamics. The described dataset supports research in data-driven wireless modeling and the development of high-capacity indoor communication networks.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00494v3", "date":

{"title": "MoToRec: Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation", "author": "Jialin Liu and Zhaorui Zhang and Ray C. C. Cheung", "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized recommender systems by effectively modeling complex user-item interactions, yet data sparsity and the item cold-start problem significantly impair performance, particularly for new items with limited or no interaction history. While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11062v1",

{"title": "A Diffusion-Based Generative Prior Approach to Sparse-view Computed Tomography", "author": "Davide Evangelista and Pasquale Cascarano and Elena Loli Piccolomini", "abstract": "The reconstruction of X-rays CT images from sparse or limited-angle geometries is a highly challenging task. The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10722v1", "date":

However, in gated linear attention models, this memory has a fixed capacity and is prone to interference, especially for long sequences. We propose Palimpsa, a self-attention model that views ICL as a continual learning problem that must address a stability-plasticity dilemma. Palimpsa uses Bayesian metaplasticity, where the plasticity of each attention state is tied to an importance state grounded by a prior distribution that captures accumulated knowledge. We demonstrate that various gated linear attention models emerge as specific architecture choices and posterior approximations, and that Mamba2 is a special case of Palimpsa where forgetting dominates. This theoretical link enables the transformation of any non-metaplastic model into a metaplastic one, significantly expanding its memory capacity. Our experiments show that Palimpsa consistently outperforms baselines on the Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) benchmark and on Commonsense Reasoning tasks.", "link":

{"title": "Interpretable Graph-Level Anomaly Detection via Contrast with Normal Prototypes", "author": "Qiuran Zhao and Kai Ming Ting and Xinpeng Li", "abstract": "The task of graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) is to identify anomalous graphs that deviate significantly from the majority of graphs in a dataset. While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10708v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.4093, "topK": [{"title": "UGG: Unified Generative Grasping",

{"title": "When Fusion Helps and When It Breaks: View-Aligned Robustness in Same-Source Financial Imaging", "author": "Rui Ma", "abstract": "We study same-source multi-view learning and adversarial robustness for next-day direction prediction with financial image representations. On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation.", "link":

{"title": "Efficient Learning on Large Graphs using a Densifying Regularity Lemma", "author": "Jonathan Kouchly and Ben Finkelshtein and Michael Bronstein and Ron Levie", "abstract": "Learning on large graphs presents significant challenges, with traditional Message Passing Neural Networks suffering from computational and memory costs scaling linearly with the number of edges. We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18273v3", "date": "2026-02-11",

{"title": "Chart Specification: Structural Representations for Incentivizing VLM Reasoning in Chart-to-Code Generation", "author": "Minggui He and Mingchen Dai and Jian Zhang and Yilun Liu and Shimin Tao and Pufan Zeng and Osamu Yoshie and Yuya Ieiri", "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating plotting code from chart images, yet achieving structural fidelity remains challenging. Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

Classical techniques face intrinsic limitations near moving interfaces, while existing neural rendering methods target single-phase flows with diffuse boundaries and cannot handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces. We propose SurfPhase, a novel model for reconstructing 3D interfacial dynamics from sparse camera views. Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations. We evaluate on a new dataset of high-speed pool boiling videos, demonstrating high-quality view synthesis and velocity estimation from only two camera views.

{"title": "Enhancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Global Temporal Retrieval", "author": "Fanpu Cao and Lu Dai and Jindong Han and Hui Xiong", "abstract": "Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in numerous real-world applications, yet existing models remain constrained by their reliance on a limited historical context. This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks.

{"title": "HOGraspFlow: Taxonomy-Aware Hand-Object Retargeting for Multi-Modal SE(3) Grasp Generation", "author": "Yitian Shi and Zicheng Guo and Rosa Wolf and Edgar Welte and Rania Rayyes", "abstract": "We propose Hand-Object\\emph{(HO)GraspFlow}, an affordance-centric approach that retargets a single RGB with hand-object interaction (HOI) into multi-modal executable parallel jaw grasps without explicit geometric priors on target objects. Building on foundation models for hand reconstruction and vision, we synthesize $SE(3)$ grasp poses with denoising flow matching (FM), conditioned on the following three complementary cues: RGB foundation features as visual semantics, HOI contact reconstruction, and taxonomy-aware prior on grasp types. Our approach demonstrates high fidelity in grasp synthesis without explicit HOI contact input or object geometry, while maintaining strong contact and taxonomy recognition. Another controlled comparison shows that \\emph{HOGraspFlow} consistently outperforms diffusion-based variants (\\emph{HOGraspDiff}), achieving high distributional fidelity and more stable optimization in $SE(3)$. We demonstrate a reliable, object-agnostic grasp synthesis from human demonstrations in real-world experiments, where an average success rate of over $83\\%$ is achieved.

{"title": "Beyond Gemini-3-Pro: Revisiting LLM Routing and Aggregation at Scale", "author": "Shengji Tang and Weihao Lin and Peng Ye and Jingqi Ye and Hao Li and Yiqun Zhang and Xiaosong Wang and Bo Zhang and Shuyue Hu and Tao Chen and Lei Bai and Wanli Ouyang", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced, with Gemini-3-Pro setting a new performance milestone. In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines. It suggests that collective intelligence represents a novel path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01330v2", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy":

{"title": "Safe mobility support system using crowd mapping and avoidance route planning using VLM", "author": "Sena Saito and Kenta Tabata and Renato Miyagusuku and Koichi Ozaki", "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots offer promising solutions for labor shortages and increased operational efficiency. However, navigating safely and effectively in dynamic environments, particularly crowded areas, remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to generate dynamic crowd-density maps (``Abstraction Maps'') for autonomous robot navigation. Our approach utilizes VLM's capability to recognize abstract environmental concepts, such as crowd densities, and represents them probabilistically via GPR. Experimental results from real-world trials on a university campus demonstrated that robots successfully generated routes avoiding both static obstacles and dynamic crowds, enhancing navigation safety

{"title": "Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments", "author": "Minzhe Zheng and Lei Zheng and Lei Zhu and Jun Ma", "abstract": "Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to enhance safety. Based on these constraints, the CMPC constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to strike a balance between safety and performance. A shared consensus segment is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.", "link":

{"title": "Deep Network Trainability via Persistent Subspace Orthogonality", "author": "Alex Massucco and Davide Murari and Carola-Bibiane Sch\u00f6nlieb", "abstract": "Training neural networks via backpropagation is often hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. In this work, we design architectures that mitigate these issues by analyzing and controlling the network Jacobian. We first provide a unified characterization for a class of networks with orthogonal Jacobian including known architectures and yielding new trainable designs. We then introduce the relaxed notion of persistent subspace orthogonality. This applies to a broader class of networks whose Jacobians are isometries only on a non-trivial subspace. We propose practical mechanisms to enforce this condition and empirically show that it is necessary to sufficiently preserve the gradient norms during backpropagation, enabling the training of very deep networks. We support our theory with extensive experiments.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02882v2", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.3369, "topK": [{"title": "Boosted dynamic neural networks",

{"title": "LoRA-Squeeze: Simple and Effective Post-Tuning and In-Tuning Compression of LoRA Modules", "author": "Ivan Vuli\u0107 and Adam Grycner and Quentin de Laroussilhe and Jonas Pfeiffer", "abstract": "Despite its huge number of variants, standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is still a dominant technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10993v1", "date":

{"title": "PA-MPPI: Perception-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral Control for Quadrotor Navigation in Unknown Environments", "author": "Yifan Zhai and Rudolf Reiter and Davide Scaramuzza", "abstract": "Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving this problem requires addressing three key challenges: path planning in non-convex free space due to obstacles, satisfying quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and exploring unknown regions to expand the map. Recently, the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution to the first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs such as energy consumption. However, MPPI has been limited to tracking control that optimizes trajectories only within a small neighborhood around a reference trajectory, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions and plan alternative paths when blocked by large obstacles. To address this limitation, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI (PA-MPPI). In this approach, perception-awareness is characterized by planning and adapting the trajectory online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded, PA-MPPI incorporates a perception cost that biases trajectories toward those that can observe unknown regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz, performs on par with the state-of-the-art quadrotor navigation planner for unknown environments in challenging test scenarios. Furthermore, we show that PA-MPPI can serve as a safe and robust action policy for navigation foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly reachable.", "link":

{"title": "RADAR: Benchmarking Vision-Language-Action Generalization via Real-World Dynamics, Spatial-Physical Intelligence, and Autonomous Evaluation", "author": "Yuhao Chen and Zhihao Zhan and Xiaoxin Lin and Zijian Song and Hao Liu and Qinhan Lyu and Yubo Zu and Xiao Chen and Zhiyuan Liu and Tao Pu and Tianshui Chen and Keze Wang and Liang Lin and Guangrun Wang", "abstract": "VLA models have achieved remarkable progress in embodied intelligence; however, their evaluation remains largely confined to simulations or highly constrained real-world settings. This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10980v1", "date": "2026-02-11",

{"title": "GeoPurify: A Data-Efficient Geometric Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary 3D Segmentation", "author": "Weijia Dou and Xu Zhang and Yi Bin and Jian Liu and Bo Peng and Guoqing Wang and Yang Yang and Heng Tao Shen", "abstract": "Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data.", "link":

{"title": "Self-Supervised Learning for Speaker Recognition: A study and review", "author": "Theo Lepage and Reda Dehak", "abstract": "Deep learning models trained in a supervised setting have revolutionized audio and speech processing. However, their performance inherently depends on the quantity of human-annotated data, making them costly to scale and prone to poor generalization under unseen conditions. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled data to learn relevant representations. The application of SSL for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively studied, but research on other downstream tasks, notably Speaker Recognition (SR), remains in its early stages. This work describes major SSL instance-invariance frameworks (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, and DINO), initially developed for computer vision, along with their adaptation to SR. Various SSL methods for SR, proposed in the literature and built upon these frameworks, are also presented. An extensive review of these approaches is then conducted: (1) the effect of the main hyperparameters of SSL frameworks is investigated; (2) the role of SSL components is studied (e.g., data-augmentation, projector, positive sampling); and (3) SSL frameworks are evaluated on SR with in-domain and out-of-domain data, using a consistent experimental setup, and a comprehensive comparison of SSL methods from the literature is provided. Specifically, DINO achieves the best downstream performance and effectively models intra-speaker variability, although it is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and training conditions, while SimCLR and MoCo provide robust alternatives that effectively capture inter-speaker variability and are less prone to collapse. This work aims to highlight recent trends and advancements, identifying current challenges in the field.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10829v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.3117,

We propose \\emph{Attention-Enhanced Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (AE-MAPPO)}, which integrates six specialized attention mechanisms into multi-agent slice control and surfaces them as zero-cost, faithful explanations. The framework operates across O-RAN timescales with a three-phase strategy: predictive, reactive, and inter-slice optimization.\n  A URLLC case study shows AE-MAPPO resolves a latency spike in $18$ms, restores latency to $0.98$ms with $99.9999\\%$ reliability, and reduces troubleshooting time by $93\\%$ while maintaining eMBB and mMTC continuity. These results confirm AE-MAPPO's ability to combine SLA compliance with inherent interpretability, enabling trustworthy and real-time automation for 6G RAN slicing.", "link":

{"title": "On the Optimal Reasoning Length for RL-Trained Language Models", "author": "Daisuke Nohara and Taishi Nakamura and Rio Yokota", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning substantially improves reasoning in large language models, but it also tends to lengthen chain of thought outputs and increase computational cost during both training and inference. Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.", "link":

{"title": "Motion Capture is Not the Target Domain: Scaling Synthetic Data for Learning Motion Representations", "author": "Firas Darwish and George Nicholson and Aiden Doherty and Hang Yuan", "abstract": "Synthetic data offers a compelling path to scalable pretraining when real-world data is scarce, but models pretrained on synthetic data often fail to transfer reliably to deployment settings. We study this problem in full-body human motion, where large-scale data collection is infeasible but essential for wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and where synthetic motion can be generated from motion-capture-derived representations. We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. We also demonstrate that large-scale motion-capture pretraining yields only marginal gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals, clarifying key sim-to-real challenges and the limits and opportunities of synthetic motion data for transferable HAR representations.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11064v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.3008, "topK": [{"title": "Synthesizing

{"title": "FD-DB: Frequency-Decoupled Dual-Branch Network for Unpaired Synthetic-to-Real Domain Translation", "author": "Chuanhai Zang and Jiabao Hu and XW Song", "abstract": "Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09476v2", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.2993, "topK": [{"title": "SDXS: Real-Time One-Step Latent Diffusion Models with Image

We propose SimuScene, the first systematic study that trains and evaluates LLMs on simulating physical scenarios across five physics domains and 52 physical concepts. We build an automatic pipeline to collect data, with human verification to ensure quality. The final dataset contains 7,659 physical scenarios with 334 human-verified examples as the test set. We evaluated 10 contemporary LLMs and found that even the strongest model achieves only a 21.5% pass rate, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. Finally, we introduce a reinforcement learning pipeline with visual rewards that uses a vision-language model as a judge to train textual models. Experiments show that training with our data improves physical simulation via code while substantially enhancing general code generation performance.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10840v1",

We present MOSAIC, an open-source, full-stack system for humanoid motion tracking and whole-body teleoperation across multiple interfaces. MOSAIC first learns a teleoperation-oriented general motion tracker via RL on a multi-source motion bank with adaptive resampling and rewards that emphasize world-frame motion consistency, which is critical for mobile teleoperation. To bridge the sim-to-real interface gap without sacrificing generality, MOSAIC then performs rapid residual adaptation: an interface-specific policy is trained using minimal interface-specific data, and then distilled into the general tracker through an additive residual module, outperforming naive fine-tuning or continual learning. We validate MOSAIC with systematic ablations, out-of-distribution benchmarking, and real-robot experiments demonstrating robust offline motion replay and online long-horizon teleoperation under realistic latency and noise.

{"title": "Intrinsic Self-Correction in LLMs: Towards Explainable Prompting via Mechanistic Interpretability", "author": "Yu-Ting Lee and Fu-Chieh Chang and Yu-En Shu and Hui-Ying Shih and Pei-Yuan Wu", "abstract": "Intrinsic self-correction refers to the phenomenon where a language model refines its own outputs purely through prompting, without external feedback or parameter updates. While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its mechanism remains unclear. We show that intrinsic self-correction functions by steering hidden representations along interpretable latent directions, as evidenced by both alignment analysis and activation interventions. To achieve this, we analyze intrinsic self-correction via the representation shift induced by prompting. In parallel, we construct interpretable latent directions with contrastive pairs and verify the causal effect of these directions via activation addition. Evaluating six open-source LLMs, our results demonstrate that prompt-induced representation shifts in text detoxification and text toxification consistently align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These findings suggest that representation steering is the mechanistic driver of intrinsic self-correction. Our analysis highlights that understanding model internals offers a direct route to analyzing the mechanisms of prompt-driven LLM behaviors.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11924v3", "date":

{"title": "Integrating Generative AI-enhanced Cognitive Systems in Higher Education: From Stakeholder Perceptions to a Conceptual Framework considering the EU AI Act", "author": "Da-Lun Chen and Prasasthy Balasubramanian and Lauri Lov\u00e9n and Susanna Pirttikangas and Jaakko Sauvola and Panagiotis Kostakos", "abstract": "Many staff and students in higher education have adopted generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in their work and study. GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance.", "link":

{"title": "Enhancing Predictability of Multi-Tenant DNN Inference for Autonomous Vehicles' Perception", "author": "Liangkai Liu and Kang G. Shin and Jinkyu Lee and Chengmo Yang and Weisong Shi", "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11004v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.2732, "topK":

However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

{"title": "Are Dense Labels Always Necessary for 3D Object Detection from Point Cloud?", "author": "Chenqiang Gao and Chuandong Liu and Jun Shu and Fangcen Liu and Jiang Liu and Luyu Yang and Xinbo Gao and Deyu Meng", "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object detection methods often require a large amount of 3D bounding box annotations for training. However, collecting such large-scale densely-supervised datasets is notoriously costly. To reduce the cumbersome data annotation process, we propose a novel sparsely-annotated framework, in which we just annotate one 3D object per scene. Such a sparse annotation strategy could significantly reduce the heavy annotation burden, while inexact and incomplete sparse supervision may severely deteriorate the detection performance. To address this issue, we develop the SS3D++ method that alternatively improves 3D detector training and confident fully-annotated scene generation in a unified learning scheme. Using sparse annotations as seeds, we progressively generate confident fully-annotated scenes based on designing a missing-annotated instance mining module and reliable background mining module. Our proposed method produces competitive results when compared with SOTA weakly-supervised methods using the same or even more annotation costs. Besides, compared with SOTA fully-supervised methods, we achieve on-par or even better performance on the KITTI dataset with about 5x less annotation cost, and 90% of their performance on the Waymo dataset with about 15x less annotation cost. The additional unlabeled training scenes could further boost the performance.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02818v2", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.2691, "topK": [{"title": "MEDL-U:

{"title": "Adaptive Sampling for Private Worst-Case Group Optimization", "author": "Max Cairney-Leeming and Amartya Sanyal and Christoph H. Lampert", "abstract": "Models trained by minimizing the average loss often fail to be accurate on small or hard-to-learn groups of the data. Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average

Shahria Alam and Mohammad Tahmid Noor and Nishat Tasnim Niloy", "abstract": "Guava fruits often suffer from many diseases. This can harm fruit quality and fruit crop yield. Early identification is important for minimizing damage and ensuring fruit health. This study focuses on 3 different categories for classifying diseases. These are Anthracnose, Fruit flies, and Healthy fruit. The data set used in this study is collected from Mendeley Data. This dataset contains 473 original images of Guava. These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency. After this, the Data augmentation process is applied to improve the dataset by generating variations of the original images. The augmented dataset consists of 3784 images using advanced preprocessing techniques. Two deep learning models were implemented to classify the images. The InceptionV3 model is well known for its advanced framework. These apply multiple convolutional filters for obtaining different features effectively. On the other hand, the ResNet50 model helps to train deeper networks by using residual learning. The InceptionV3 model achieved the impressive accuracy of 98.15%, and ResNet50got 94.46% accuracy. Data mixing methods such as CutMix and MixUp were applied to enhance the model's robustness. The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the overall model performance of both InceptionV3 and Resnet50. Additionally, SHAP analysis is used to improve interpretability, which helps to find the significant parts of the image for the model prediction.

{"title": "Interpretable Vision Transformers in Monocular Depth Estimation via SVDA", "author": "Vasileios Arampatzakis and George Pavlidis and Nikolaos Mitianoudis and Nikos Papamarkos", "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is a central problem in computer vision with applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous driving, yet the self-attention mechanisms that drive modern Transformer architectures remain opaque. We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11005v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.2558, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D Scene\n

{"title": "Tuning the burn-in phase in training recurrent neural networks improves their performance", "author": "Julian D. Schiller and Malte Heinrich and Victor G. Lopez and Matthias A. M\u00fcller", "abstract": "Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) can be challenging, especially in the presence of long input sequences. A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10911v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.2547, "topK": [{"title": "Boosted dynamic neural networks", "link":

This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10809v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 2.2542, "topK": [{"title": "Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D Scene\n

While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.", "link":

{"title": "Towards Safe Path Tracking Using the Simplex Architecture", "author": "Georg J\u00e4ger and Nils-Jonathan Friedrich and Hauke Petersen and Benjamin Noack", "abstract": "Robot navigation in complex environments necessitates controllers that prioritize safety while remaining performant and adaptable. Traditional controllers like Regulated Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach, and Model-Predictive Path Integral, while reliable, struggle to adapt to dynamic conditions. Reinforcement Learning offers adaptability but state-wise safety guarantees remain challenging and often absent in practice. To address this, we propose a path tracking controller leveraging the Simplex architecture. It combines a Reinforcement Learning controller for adaptiveness and performance with a high-assurance controller providing safety and stability. Our main goal is to provide a safe testbed for the design and evaluation of path-planning algorithms, including machine-learning-based planners. Our contribution is twofold. We firstly discuss general stability and safety considerations for designing controllers using the Simplex architecture. Secondly, we present a Simplex-based path tracking controller. Our simulation results, supported by preliminary in-field tests, demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in maintaining safety while achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.",

Text-based parsers often discard layout semantics and introduce unstructured noise, while long-horizon training typically relies on sparse outcome rewards that obscure which retrieval actions actually matter. We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

Toral Mar\u00edn and Samuel Yanes Luis", "abstract": "The evaluation of informative path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles is often hindered by fragmented execution pipelines and limited transferability between simulation and real-world deployment. This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline. The approach is validated through a set of experiments, including real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle performing water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback.", "link":

{"title": "CVPL: A Geometric Framework for Post-Hoc Linkage Risk Assessment in Protected Tabular Data", "author": "Valery Khvatov and Alexey Neyman", "abstract": "Formal privacy metrics provide compliance-oriented guarantees but often fail to quantify actual linkability in released datasets. We introduce CVPL (Cluster-Vector-Projection Linkage), a geometric framework for post-hoc assessment of linkage risk between original and protected tabular data. CVPL represents linkage analysis as an operator pipeline comprising blocking, vectorization, latent projection, and similarity evaluation, yielding continuous, scenario-dependent risk estimates rather than binary compliance verdicts. We formally define CVPL under an explicit threat model and introduce threshold-aware risk surfaces, R(lambda, tau), that capture the joint effects of protection strength and attacker strictness. We establish a progressive blocking strategy with monotonicity guarantees, enabling anytime risk estimation with valid lower bounds. We demonstrate that the classical Fellegi-Sunter linkage emerges as a special case of CVPL under restrictive assumptions, and that violations of these assumptions can lead to systematic over-linking bias. Empirical validation on 10,000 records across 19 protection configurations demonstrates that formal k-anonymity compliance may coexist with substantial empirical linkability, with a significant portion arising from non-quasi-identifier behavioral patterns. CVPL provides interpretable diagnostics identifying which features drive linkage feasibility, supporting privacy impact assessment, protection mechanism comparison, and utility-risk trade-off

{"title": "Scalable Spatio-Temporal SE(3) Diffusion for Long-Horizon Protein Dynamics", "author": "Nima Shoghi and Yuxuan Liu and Yuning Shen and Rob Brekelmans and Pan Li and Quanquan Gu", "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain the gold standard for studying protein dynamics, but their computational cost limits access to biologically relevant timescales. Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02128v2", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy":

While recent advances in self-supervised depth estimation have reduced reliance on ground truth supervision, existing approaches remain constrained by either bulky architectures compromising practicality or lightweight models sacrificing structural precision. These dual limitations underscore the critical need to develop lightweight yet structurally precise architectures. Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification. Through effective collaboration, these modules enable PuriLight to achieve both lightweight and accurate feature extraction and processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuriLight achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal training parameters while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency.

{"title": "VulReaD: Knowledge-Graph-guided Software Vulnerability Reasoning and Detection", "author": "Samal Mukhtar and Yinghua Yao and Zhu Sun and Mustafa Mustafa and Yew Soon Ong and Youcheng Sun", "abstract": "Software vulnerability detection (SVD) is a critical challenge in modern systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10787v1",

{"title": "Divide, Harmonize, Then Conquer It: Shooting Multi-Commodity Flow Problems with Multimodal Language Models", "author": "Xinyu Yuan and Yan Qiao and Zonghui Wang and Wenzhi Chen", "abstract": "The multi-commodity flow (MCF) problem is a fundamental topic in network flow and combinatorial optimization, with broad applications in transportation, communication, and logistics, etc. Nowadays, the rapid expansion of allocation systems has posed challenges for existing optimization engines in balancing optimality and tractability. In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11057v1",

{"title": "APEX: Learning Adaptive High-Platform Traversal for Humanoid Robots", "author": "Yikai Wang and Tingxuan Leng and Changyi Lin and Shiqi Liu and Shir Simon and Bingqing Chen and Jonathan Francis and Ding Zhao", "abstract": "Humanoid locomotion has advanced rapidly with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling robust feet-based traversal over uneven terrain. Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11143v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 1.6923, "topK": [{"title": "RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned

{"title": "Localized Control in Diffusion Models via Latent Vector Prediction", "author": "Pablo Domingo-Gregorio and Javier Ruiz-Hidalgo", "abstract": "Diffusion models emerged as a leading approach in text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, attempting to achieve detailed control to get a desired image solely through text remains a laborious trial-and-error endeavor. Recent methods have introduced image-level controls alongside with text prompts, using prior images to extract conditional information such as edges, segmentation and depth maps. While effective, these methods apply conditions uniformly across the entire image, limiting localized control. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enable precise local control over user-defined regions of an image, while leaving to the diffusion model the task of autonomously generating the remaining areas according to the original prompt. Our approach introduces a new training framework that incorporates masking features and an additional loss term, which leverages the prediction of the initial latent vector at any diffusion step to enhance the correspondence between the current step and the final sample in the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively synthesizes high-quality images with controlled local conditions.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01991v2", "date": "2026-02-11",

{"title": "RISE: Self-Improving Robot Policy with Compositional World Model", "author": "Jiazhi Yang and Kunyang Lin and Jinwei Li and Wencong Zhang and Tianwei Lin and Longyan Wu and Zhizhong Su and Hao Zhao and Ya-Qin Zhang and Li Chen and Ping Luo and Xiangyu Yue and Hongyang Li", "abstract": "Despite the sustained scaling on model capacity and data acquisition, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, where minor execution deviations can compound into failures. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11075v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy": 1.6697, "topK": [{"title": "RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned Scene Graph via

{"title": "Implementing Grassroots Logic Programs with Multiagent Transition Systems and AI", "author": "Ehud Shapiro", "abstract": "Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language with variables partitioned into paired \\emph{readers} and \\emph{writers}, conjuring both linear logic and futures/promises: an assignment is produced at most once via the sole occurrence of a writer (promise) and consumed at most once via the sole occurrence of its paired reader (future), and may contain additional readers and/or writers, enabling the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities.\n  GLP was designed as a language for grassroots platforms -- distributed systems with multiple instances that can operate independently of each other and of any global resource, and can coalesce into ever larger instances -- with its target architecture being smartphones communicating peer-to-peer. The operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP and of multiagent GLP (maGLP) were defined via transition systems/multiagent transition systems, respectively.\n  Here, we describe the mathematics developed to facilitate the workstation- and smartphone-based implementations of GLP by AI in Dart. We developed dGLP -- implementation-ready deterministic operational semantics for single-agent GLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the Concurrent GLP operational semantics; dGLP was used by AI as a formal spec, from which it developed a workstation-based implementation of GLP. We developed madGLP -- an implementation-ready multiagent operational semantics for maGLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the maGLP operational semantics; madGLP is deterministic at the agent level (not at the system level due to communication asynchrony), and is being used by AI as a formal spec from which it develops a smartphone-based implementation of maGLP.", "link":

{"title": "Controllable Logical Hypothesis Generation for Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs", "author": "Yisen Gao and Jiaxin Bai and Tianshi Zheng and Qingyun Sun and Ziwei Zhang and Xingcheng Fu and Jianxin Li and Yangqiu Song", "abstract": "Abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs aims to generate plausible logical hypotheses from observed entities, with broad applications in areas such as clinical diagnosis and scientific discovery. However, due to a lack of controllability, a single observation may yield numerous plausible but redundant or irrelevant hypotheses on large-scale knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of controllable hypothesis generation to improve the practical utility of abductive reasoning. This task faces two key challenges when controlling for generating long and complex logical hypotheses: hypothesis space collapse and hypothesis oversensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose CtrlHGen, a Controllable logcial Hypothesis Generation framework for abductive reasoning over knowledge graphs, trained in a two-stage paradigm including supervised learning and subsequent reinforcement learning. To mitigate hypothesis space collapse, we design a dataset augmentation strategy based on sub-logical decomposition, enabling the model to learn complex logical structures by leveraging semantic patterns in simpler components. To address hypothesis oversensitivity, we incorporate smoothed semantic rewards including Dice and Overlap scores, and introduce a condition-adherence reward to guide the generation toward user-specified control constraints. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model not only better adheres to control conditions but also achieves superior semantic similarity performance compared to baselines.

{"title": "FeatureBench: Benchmarking Agentic Coding for Complex Feature Development", "author": "Qixing Zhou and Jiacheng Zhang and Haiyang Wang and Rui Hao and Jiahe Wang and Minghao Han and Yuxue Yang and Shuzhe Wu and Feiyang Pan and Lue Fan and Dandan Tu and Zhaoxiang Zhang", "abstract": "Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in the software industry, contributing code as collaborators or even autonomous developers. As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10975v1", "date": "2026-02-11", "relevancy":

{"title": "Algorithmically Establishing Trust in Evaluators", "author": "Adrian de Wynter", "abstract": "An evaluator, such as an LLM-as-a-judge, is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure its performance as a labeller. Traditional approaches either rely on testing the evaluator against references or assume that it `knows' somehow the correct labelling. Both approaches fail when references are unavailable: the former requires data, and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce the `No-Data Algorithm', which provably establishes trust in an evaluator without requiring any labelled data. Our algorithm works by successively posing challenges to said evaluator. We prove that after $r$ challenge rounds, it accepts an evaluator which knows the correct labels with probability $ \\geq 1 - (1/4)^r$, and reliably flags untrustworthy ones. We present formal proofs of correctness, empirical tests, and applications to assessing trust in LLMs-as-judges for low-resource language labelling. Our work enables scientifically-grounded evaluator trust in low-data domains, addressing a critical bottleneck for scalable, trustworthy LLM deployment.", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03083v4",

{"title": "Provable Emergence of Deep Neural Collapse and Low-Rank Bias in $L^2$-Regularized Nonlinear Networks", "author": "Emanuele Zangrando and Piero Deidda and Simone Brugiapaglia and Nicola Guglielmi and Francesco Tudisco", "abstract": "We present a unified theoretical framework connecting the first property of Deep Neural Collapse (DNC1) to the emergence of implicit low-rank bias in nonlinear networks trained with $L^2$ weight decay regularization. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we derive a quantitative relation between the Total Cluster Variation (TCV) of intermediate embeddings and the numerical rank of stationary weight matrices. In particular, we establish that, at any critical point, the distance from a weight matrix to the set of rank-$K$ matrices is bounded by a constant times the TCV of earlier-layer features, scaled inversely with the weight-decay parameter. Second, we prove global optimality of DNC1 in a constrained representation-cost setting for both feedforward and residual architectures, showing that zero TCV across intermediate layers minimizes the representation cost under natural architectural constraints. Third, we establish a benign landscape property: for almost every interpolating initialization there exists a continuous, loss-decreasing path from the initialization to a globally optimal, DNC1-satisfying configuration. Our theoretical claims are validated empirically; numerical experiments confirm the predicted relations among TCV, singular-value structure, and weight decay. These results indicate that neural collapse and low-rank bias are intimately linked phenomena arising from the optimization geometry induced by weight decay.", "link":
